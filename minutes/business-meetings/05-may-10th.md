_Dan:_
+ Over the course of the day (10am-3pm), you help the business owners think about the problem & how they can translate it to a digital solution.
+ Mix of English speakers and non-English speakers
+ Depending on numbers, we aim to get at least one PO with a team of 2 devs
+ If we get more people than we expect, we can switch things up & try to group similar ideas together.
+ Most of you won't have done anything quite like this before. In a way, you're going to have to guide the POs & tease out of them what their idea is. Most who are unfamiliar with Tech usually bring very large ideas, based on apps they've used before e.g. facebook for their guesthouse.
+ Morning workshopping - how:
  + Get into groups, at least 1 person able to speak Arabic (so POs don't feel too out of it - most won't have experience of building software products)
  + Series of brainstorming tasks
  + Important: condense their idea down into something small and solveable. Try to take their big mix of problems and turn it into something we can solve for them.
  + Sometimes they drift away from their idea, into excitement about building a web app. It's your job to gently steer them back to the key problem they want to solve.
  + Find a problem that lends itself easily to a single user journey, even if it's not the entire app, can truly encapsulate the _usefulness_ of the entire app.
  + Need to give them help on defining their user journey. In the UK I talk a lot about the difference between a user story and a user journey. That's overkill here. We want them to think about one thing that a user of an app might do. Try to distill it.  
  + Imagine that user journey as a series of SMS messages - get them away from thinking about apps that they're familiar with, or thinking from the point of view of a web-based interface. Focus on the idea itself - better solutions :tada:
+ Light working lunch. As soon as lunch is finished, we want them to deliver 3 minute pitches.
  + The 2 or 3 devs working with the PO should help them put this together. Help them to put together some bullet pointed ideas. Maybe have a translator.
+ It's not the quality of you as software developers, it's the quality of the PO. If they're not pitching & they're not engaged, they won't get fully engaged. We want to get them on github, raising issues. We need them fully engaged, so that when we deliver functionality, they will be engaged with user testing.
+ After pitches, devs schedule a meeting with the client, to prepare them.  
**The quality of client engagement is even more important than the quality of ideas.**
+ During the week after this, you will be designing & prototyping, with support form Noga (available until Thursday next week)

_Rebecca:_
+ This is not just about the clients giving FAC students practice. You are providing something that is supposed to be of real value for them.
+ Once the workshop ends, it's a professional relationship between you and the client.

_Dan:_
+ Cut it down aggressively 2 or 3 projects that people really want to work on.
+ For those of you going to London, there is the choice to work on a project that you started here, or maybe you want to get involved with what's going on there. A lot will depend on how much interest we get here, and how many projects we get.
+ Or you could go to London and stay on a Nazareth team. If part of your team is in London, it could be a really good opportunity to try working remotely. So leaving Nazareth doesn't necessarily mean leaving what's happening here.

_Rebecca:_
+ It may make the most sense to stay here for the prototyping here in Nazareth, and then go to London

_Edgar:_
+ How many signed up?

_Rebecca:_
+ 14 + Sarina (will step up to be a PO if we don't have enough engaged POs), Tariq, Maroon. We have people in our own camp who will be coming either way.  
  + Just sent confirmation emails this afternoon.  
  + Most have spoken directly with Sarin, Tariq, Maroon or Edgar.  
  + Received feedback that finishing at 6pm was too late on a Friday  


_Mavis:_ How much to the potential POs know about what we're doing and what it is?

_Dan:_ Zero

_Rebecca:_ What they know is the contents of the email I'm sending to you all now. I'll send you this so that you can share it with anyone else who may be interested, and you know how much the participants know about the workshop


## [Update from FAC International](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/issues/27)
_Rebecca:_
+ Decision that we made in January in London - setting up a separate charity, incorporated in the UK, for individual campuses to be their own entities.
+ This is meant to be an update so that everyone in the FAC community knows what's happening at each of the locations.
+ Membership-based charity: board of trustees, membership with decision-making power. Still working out membership process.
+ [Charitable purposes](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/blob/11fda05ed455811cbf3cc5dbb094c47ef0c93314/purpose.md) (link to latest version, currently in a PR)  
These are supposed to be both aspirational & limiting. At the moment we're not fulfilling the first.  
2nd purpose - the idea is, if we're presented with the opportunity to go somewhere, but it doesn't help us fulfill our second purpose, we shouldn't go.

_Mavis:_ Is the 2nd one saying that funding has to be part of it?

_Dan:_ Becoming a charity makes applying for funding much more straight forward. In London we've survived for 3 years without any funding. But now we're expanding.

_Rebecca:_
+ The paperwork is in process. It's a very slow process. But this is getting submitted when we go back to London.
+ Been advised by the lawyer to start small. We've decided to start with the minimum number of trustees. Natalia was on FAC3 and instrumental in its growth, currently works at The Guardian.
Nelson is an extremely accomplished software developer & one of the directors of DWYL, the agency that sits next door to the London campus.
Mark is heavily involved in Tech for Good work and we've brought him on, to make sure we have someone external who is not an alumnus or a director, etc.
+ We've been advised to keep our board of trustees mainly in the UK for banking reasons.
+ Ines is an unpaid advisor to the staff
+ Developing a process for adding members and trustees. Members are a higher priority than trustees. If that's something you are interested in, please register your interest and contribute to the repo. As soon as we have a process for making this possible, you will be told so that we can draw on the wealth of experience & skills.
+ Trustees are unpaid (to ensure neutrality). They have 2 roles: make sure what we're doing is in line with our purpose & the financial responsibility ultimately stops with them.  
In the beginning, they have volunteered to be quite a lot more involved, so that members have a roadmap for new campuses. But over the next 6 months, they will pull back and be less involved in what's happening day to day.


## [Mentoring FACN2](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues/123)
_Rebecca:_
+ Each participant selects 2 weeks from the first 8 weeks of the programme.  
Select someone that you want to work with on those weeks & come back to the space with.
+ That will be quite difficult for some of you. It's not compulsory. We wouldn't want you to do something that you don't want to do. But many people find it an even more valuable part of the course, because it will push you harder.
+ We will create a spreadhseet with weeks 1-8 & the topic, where you can add yourself & your partner for a given week.
+ Dan and I will be around for the next 2 days. You can ask us anything, whether you have any concerns or questions. In terms of logistics, and maybe having somewhere to stay, you can also get in touch with Shireen.
+ If we could have at least a tentative commitment by the time Dan and I leave (or by mid-week next week), we would like to start coordinating mentor schedules with those from FAC10 who are interested.
+ The priority is having mentors from this course, and we will be plugging in other people where there are gaps. Also, if you want support - for example if it was a really hard week for your cohort - let us know and we can try and make sure there are more people here on those weeks.
+ The 2nd half of the course is also an option if you want, so do register your interest.
+ We're actively in conversation with multiple embassies to try and avoid Eoin's problems in the future.
+ Mentoring in London. Internally, our priority would be enabling you to come back here and mentor. But we understand that some of you will be looking for employment. You may want to come back for a later cohort.
+ We need to know about Gaza 6+ weeks in advance to we can get your documents in order. That can't be a last minute decision. The programmes will be staggered, so you might even choose to mentor the same week in multiple locations.
