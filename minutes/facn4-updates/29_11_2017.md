- Zaher is reaching out to Tsofen
- Esraa will report back with recruitment efforts in two weeks

### FACN4 Contacts
- most students understanding just want updates
- possibly a delay of four weeks? (start of April) - gives us time to market to local applicants and deliver a pre-course
- what happens if we delay?
    - some applicants might not wait around?
    - what happens to guesthouse etc in Nazareth
- need more strength and depth of local applicants (~10 currently)
- visa situation update by Idan - has personal number of assistant who is willing to talk

### Communication with projects
- Waleed wants updates from open tourism platform and education platform

### Weekly conversation
- Zaher hasn't necessarily taken care of most day to day requests
- Yvonne has a weekly call with Zaher lined up

### FACN4 selection panel
- looking for graduates to be on the panel to contact and review local applicants
- conversation and then interview?
- we aren't sure when we are starting
- go through applications and pick out who to focus on
- maybe separate issues for looking at applications and selection panel
- when does the prep course start?
- 8 weeks before the course? Feb
- shouldn't we be going for quality not quanity - start prep course earlier to get them up to a good standard

### Esraa updates
- marketing - raising an issue to work with biv dez group
- google docs about the calls
- NCTA don't have enough info to help with marketing
