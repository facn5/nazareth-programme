### 5/3/17

#### Suha & Lubes (Social Media)
- Part of marketing committee - meeting taking place tomorrow - will know more about the photo situation by then (Instagram / Snapchat stories etc.)
- Contacting high schools - perhaps through Tareq. Maybe wait a couple of weeks until we have a greater social media presence
- Look into working with Manarah - organisation working with Arabic university students / applicants
- Action point - fix an issue on the FAC website (the two main buttons on the home page link to READMEs - change this to the HARP template thing?)

#### Lawson, Hiba, Reem & Joudy (Schools)
- Meeting with teacher on Wednesday - he'll provide a list of numbers for computer science teachers - this will mainly be extra-curricular activities
- Reem's high school teacher has invited her to speak - plans to make a presentation in Arabic, maybe over the weekend
- Hiba - writing a medium article in Arabic, focusing mainly on local students
- Note some students will be undertaking exams now - we should get on with the social media before going in to schools

#### Elias & Mohammad (YouTube Channel)
- Creating a YouTube channel for FAC Nazareth
- Maybe also create a Google Plus page linked to the channel
- Can have multiple managers for a Google Plus page
- None of the videos on the main YouTube channel even have English subtitles - need to find who has access to the main channel so that the subtitles can be typed up and translated into Arabic

#### Mavis, Jack & Edgar (Nazareth Info README)
- Drafting a basic README to pool information on Nazareth - mimicking the format of the FAC notebook, but focused on life in Nazareth
- Various sections (food, shopping etc.)
- Custom Google Maps with the locations of each place
- Where to place this README? Nazareth programme repo? Might be good to make it visible to prospective applicants
- Also looking at a medium article on life in Nazareth - might be good to try and get it out before the current application window closes (April 30th)
- Need to investigate whether there's already a FAC medium channel (looks like there might be one at [medium.com/founders-coders](www.medium.com/founders-coders))
