Nazareth recruitment drive: (19/02/17)

Judy & Matt L:
- In Israel the Nazareth programme is seen as a risk as opposed to an opportunity, it might be harder to get older people who already have jobs due to this, so we may have more luck with high school leavers or generally younger people.
- Initiate contact with secondary schools with a view to hold talks in order to raise awareness and recruit
Action point: Think about schools in the local area to get into contact to

Edgar, Jack, Marvis:
 - Lack of information about Nazareth on the website, Why? Nazareth instead of anywhere else in the world?
- Contacting local press
Action point: collate information needed for nazareth applications

Lawson, Hiba, Reem:
- Schools have 'some' coding experience, maybe get in touch with those teachers at high schools to identify potential candidates
- If English only course isnt working, could tie the course into 
Action Point: Same as Judy & Matt L

Eoin - Theres a maths teacher (Siri) in the FAC building, could speak to him about which schools in the local area he thinks are appropriate.
Action Point: Talk to Siri

Elias, Mario, Mohammed:
- Youtube for recuiting, regular coding tutorials, with arabic subtitles
Action Point: Try to make research topic a screencast tutorial
