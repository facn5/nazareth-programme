### Money

Rebecca:
- $1500 accepted from the NCTA, effective immediately (from september)
- "What does FAC Naz need to survive to continue?" is what resulted in this funding
- Applied to a grant from Taawon, timing slow, but now been approved by the board.
Looking for a matching funder. Think they've found. Grants will come in quarterly, in exchange for
progress reports.
- Given confidence that funding will come in, Partners are happy to find a way to 'bridge' the organisation until the grant comes in.

Lawson: how much would funding be for?

Rebecca: grant would be 150-180 thousand dollars per year.

Dan: grant would fund 1 month of graduate projects, and living expenses for international students.

Rebecca: any more questions about money, before going into role?

All: no

### Course facilitation role

Rebecca: will ask questions, then gauge whether we might be able to get consensus

#### Benefits of one Facilitator

Dan:
Single point of contact, single point of responsibility, makes us less a hostage to fortune
make it easier to run the program, less expensive than more than one, responsibility of one Facilitator requires more experience maybe higher renumeration.
Facilitator should have a small remit, not necessarily cover everything.
Should be modeled Eoin style role, 4 month of program has significant benefits.

#### Drawbacks of one Facilitator

Mavis:
Mentions MG's comment.
Would Eoin of been able to have such a small role if there weren't so many mentors out there at the
beginning of the course?

Dan:
We have budget for those to stay in the space, volunteer in nazareth, but also for those to come out. Just opened up a 2 week naz 2 week gaza expenses paid trip.

Mavis:
Mentioned that London has CF and Program Director. Was previously unaware of that. Is it correct?

Rebecca:
PD responsibility held by Dan in London. Rebecca and Dan until now have taken on those responsibilities in Naz. It is the plan that a local alumni who is interested could take this on.
Is a more substantial (full time) role.
Given they can cover that gap, they are not asking Partners for funding.
Made calculation that Rebecca and Dan will continue to cover it until more funding comes in.

Shireen:
Cool

__Straw poll__

- All seem in favour of having one facilitator...
- Confusion about more than one facilitator.

Mavis: FACN2 would be better facilitated if one person was across everything. But not _necessarily_

Vered: As a student, it's important to have the continuity. They need to be there for the whole
8 weeks or 16 weeks.

Lee: Sharing the funding between multiple CFs is more egalitarian, but is in favour of one CF.

Rebecca: goal is a new 2 week mentor every 2 weeks in FACN3.

Dan: FAC1 grad wants to come out in Jan.

Mavis: time keeper? soft 10 min time limit?

All: yes

#### Role duration

Dan: I'm very in favour of taken role for whole cohort (16weeks).
Main reason, wants organisation to build capacity. Need people getting experience doing this.
Many people going through the programme as students, many people going through as mentors, many people going
through as CFs.
This is a peer led program. If someone stays in the role for too long, it may become teacher led.
New people coming in to refresh the role at regular intervals.

King: Would you be open to 8 week 8 week?

Dan: We've done that in Gaza. Interesting prospect. Different mix of skills. Open to the possibility
A few people mutter that they are in favour of 8/8 week.

Mavis: Large part of second half, is prep for next half.

Eoin: CF for 8 weeks, there's an overhead for organisation. Would require a lot of hiring.
Also, overlap between facilitators? Currently no paid time for handover.

Rebecca: Handover is a lot if it's 1 in 8 weeks. Generally incoming is not paid for their first week (handover)
16 weeks would become 18 weeks (week before and week after)

Lee: thinks the roles would be flexible enough, so the person has fulfilled the 16 week role, they should be able to reapply for the role immediately

Rebecca: that makes sense

Mavis: if it's peer led, and someone's there permanently could be less peer led. Could impose a 2 term limit?

Rebecca: thinks they should reapply. Likes the idea that they would CF in multiple locations, building experience.

Lubes: are they penalised if they reapply?

MG: 8 week 16 week, apply either 18 week would be preferable

Rebecca: that makes sense

Mavis: We can move on (we have enough for Rebecca and others to make a proposal)

#### Part time / full time? What does it involve

Dan:
- In favour of 20 hours a week. Limited resource, hopes spread money around.
- Individual, temporary role, they should be encouraged to excise the development of other skills
- Mentor led / peer led. It's a peer led program. Doesn't want one person to be in authority, taking  authority from the group

Mavis: is the pay hourly or monthly? 20 hr 40 hr pay the same?

Lawson: expectation of work as well if 20 hr?

Dan: if someone doing CF role, FAC would have a responsibility to find appropriate technical work to enable CF to carry on do role while doing dev work. QA, project management, client liaison, scrum work.
Given this is a role for not fresh grad, but for more experience, it would be appropriate for them to be in a QA role as well as CF.

Rebecca: not written in discussion issue, but if people are in support, the above could be included in the proposal.

Shireen: this is not a description for full time role. But if it's about mentoring or writing workshops, it's not a part time role.

Lubes: Eoin, how long did you think you spent on the role when you were at FACN1?, and how much time you spent on product?.

Eoin: Part time is a good ball park figure. It fluctuated. Things should be more 'inplace' so should be less time commitment.

Rebecca: hosting design workshops is separate paid role to CF?
Dan: yes

Mavis: Brings up problem of lack of mentors meaning CF does mentoring
When did 40 hours become a suggestion? Is that now?

Dan: In london in summer it has been full time role. Much broader than Nazareth.

MG: what makes 40 hours in london more than Nazareth

Dan: making a lot of documentation, and coordination between 3 campuses

Rebecca: to address point about Elias, in naz, doing more mentoring, unable to do as much QA [time gone]

Mav: TIME hit 10 mins
Still not assured about mentor shortage for FACN3, and that short fall would hit CF

Eoin: Jen did a lot of master-reference work in weeks 1 - 8

Rough consensus on 20 hours

#### Given available budget, what is fair rate?

Rebecca: Given figure, want to stick close to that. But open to discussion.
1500USD is what is suggested

Lubes: seems like a lot of money. seems too generous. Can we break it down?

Rebecca: assumption is that this person could get dev work elsewhere. Looking for people with slightly more experience. Want to have an applicant pool.

Mavis: did assume CF would stay in guest house as Eoin did. If not being housed, should be paid more

Rebecca: we should be able to find a private room in the guest house. we have 2 bunk rooms that can be turned into a big bunk room and a single.

Mavis: this cohort could not have one bunk room as a private

Rebecca: we have potential students wanting to share rooms. So maybe will be space

MG: 2 bunks, typically one has been for women.

Rebecca: doesn't think we need to talk about specifics not

Mavis: 1500 usd. Roughly 60 pounds a day.

Maths occurs.

Lubes and Amy think it's generous.

Eoin: It might sound a lot, but it's not a lot for developer rates.

MG: agrees with Eoin, lowering would be counter productive

Lubes: still thinks it's generous

Dan: Lubes, would you like to suggest a number which makes sense?

Lubes: can't do that, if it was less it would be less generous.

Dan: let's drop it down to 1000USD if they get a single room in the guest house.

General mutterings that 1000USD is too little.

Lee: Extra cost to organisation

Eoin: CF could have the opportunity to pay 50% rent for the room.

Mavis: if international do they get flights paid?

Dan: preference is local, but if needed yes flights paid.

Eoin: if give room to CF for half price, would balance books a bit.

Rebecca: don't focus on the balance sheet.
budgeted for two guesthouse spare rooms, could split other rooms.

Eoin: CF shouldn't assume room is free, to be fair in comparison with london

Mavis: TIME 16 min 23 secs
Where do we go from here?

Dan: forget about discussion around room. take it out of the equation.
Dan asking lubes to suggest figure

Lawson: disagress with Lubes

Rebecca: Compared with american living wage it's Cool
We'd pay for someones flight.

MOVING ON

#### If part time how can we encourage CF to engage in other projects as a developer

MG: would it make up to full time as CF + other work?

Dan: I would see it as founders and coders responsibility to make up the gap in income. If that's what the CF wants. Which is what we did with Eoin. So the person who takes on this role would need to be someone who's comfortable doing things like QAing on grad projects.

Rebecca: Help identify what CF wants and needs. This clarity would go into proposal.

MOVING on (made a little time : ) )

#### Procedures to discuss on what we need to have in place: Criteria for selection, conducting selection, criteria for evaluation.

Advertising where and to whom?
What should the application process be?

Dan: Initially brought to Nazareth. If no one in nazareth is interested, could think about broadening it out.

Mavis: FACN2 or FACN3?

Dan:Yes, the rest of FACN2, but then after that consider FACN3 STRAIGHT AWAY

Everyone nods

Rebecca: If it's an international person coming into the role, they need to apply for volunteer visa in advance, which needs 2 months. 2 months from time paper work submitted until date of arrival
Therefore we should hire for facn3 immediately

Lubes: can someone get a volunteer visa if they're getting paid?

Dan: Income directly from ncta or fac, could find a way round it.

Rebecca: agreed, wouldn't be paid by an israeli entity. It's housing and living expenses, which is law in israel anyway.

Rebecca: How long should we advertise?

Lee: two or three weeks

Lubes: one week

Rebecca: what should we require people applying?

Lee: CV, letter of intent, interview

Mavis: Experiecne

Rebecca: suggests email sent to community for transparency, visibility.
Preference given to those in naz, but wider community should know.

Dan: doesn't want email

Mavis: doesn't want email
Both willing to drop

Rebecca: should make people aware by email that we are hiring.

King: should be a section in the newsletter with a link to the issues

General agreement:
- CV
- cover letter
- advertise as issue on naz-program, fac-int, ref in london-prog on github
- announcement to community
- 2 weeks

MOVING ON

#### Criteria selection

Mavis: what about point 3 on selection bullets in issue?

Lee: skills should include administrative experience and interpersonal skills

Dan: yes, need both skills to set up a campus.

Mavis: setting up a new campus seems different role to employing for an existing campus.

Rebecca: skills e.g. resolving conflicts

Lubes: draw skills form role responsibilities.

Mavis: especially in naz, interacting with people from many cultural backgrounds

Lubes: skills should be the ability to fulfill the responsibilities

King: shall we look at the responsibilities and figure out the skills

Rebecca: reads skills from last proposal

General noddings

Rebecca: include thing about cultural understanding

Mavis: bonus to know hebrew / arabic

General agreement

Lee: also english fluently

Lubes: is it beneficial in the first 8 weeks?

Mavis: yes, for pastoral care with local students.

Rebecca: we're striving for increasing level of english for intake

Shireen: e.g. gaza, beneficial have Elias forcing them to speak english.

Mavis: we should add fluent in english.

Dan: do we have a preference for israeli nationals?
and being able to go on to work in israel?

Lee: argues against nationality being criteria, for equality reasons.

Dan: advantage of israeli nationality: they could nurture people in more responsible roles of founders and coders in israel. If israeli national, more likely to stay in israel, could then go on to be program director.
It's a question rather than a statement.

Vered: having mentored should be an advantage. (not necessity)

Lubes: having capacity to draw income form other sources should be an advantage. (not necessity)

Rebecca: and israeli national is advantage.(not necessity)

Agreement

#### Hiring panel pool

Do we want to add anything to the standard hiring process?

Mavis: if we're looking for rest of FACN2. People in this room should be on the panel as someone who has been on the ground.

Shireen: Dan and Rebecca are from international and Eoin is a previous cf.

Mav: no offense to Eoin but he hasn't been in naz since april. No one on the ground in Naz on the pool.

Rebecca: not a large group of people to draw from.
Return to question of composition of pool

Mavis: in future, most recent course facilitator should be on the pool if not applying again.

Rebecca: yes

Dan: in agreement

Rebecca: confidential process, only thing that's shared is the decision.
People need not share whether or not they are applying, but is there anything that might pose a problem?

Mavis: whether he applies depends on if others apply.

Rebecca: encourage those to apply if they are genuinely interested, don't worry if others are

Mavis + Lubes: think it would be beneficial for FACN2 if it's open this time round, i.e. everyone knows who applies

Rebecca: preference is for confidentiality
if you _want_ to tell people, fine.

Dan: if you want to put it on an issue if you decide to apply.

Rebecca: realistically not going to get someone in place until weeks 13/14.

Rebecca: could hire for FACN2 / FACN3 same time?

King: ask facn3 cf to come early.

Mavis: As of last week, no one is assigned a responsibility.

Lubes: let's assign those assignments

Shireen: are you saying we want to sign someone for facn2 and FACN3

Rebecca: No they're different, will hire for facn2, facn3 separately.

Dan: always in favour of expediency, we've budget, we've urgency.
In favour of short-cutting process. Let's get someone in this week if necessary.
Then follow due process.

Shireen: assumed we would sort it ASAP then do process in september.

Mavis: needs to be clear that this is an emergency, when opening application

Rebecca: FACN2 and facn3 should be dealt with separately

agreement

Dan: Open the application today and close it in 24 hours.

Lubes: That sounds silly. There's not even a proposal.

Mavis: FACN2 can survive without official CF another week and a half

Dan: comfortable with whatever the meeting provides

Rebecca: open applications for 3 days for CF for weeks 13 - 16. Gives a week to hire.
After Weds 13, if proposal approved.

Lee: that works if the community is aware that this application will open.

agreement

Timings change for hiring, not for the proposal.

#### How to assess the role, and evaluate the role.

Lee: are mentors currently being assessed somehow?

Agreement that mentor assessment should be a separate thing

Agreement that if the timeline becomes more urgent, Mavis will communicate with Rebecca and Dan.

---

No one seems that up for working on the proposal.

Lubes says he's interested in helping draft the proposal.

Rebecca will draft the proposal in a google doc and post it in a comment.
