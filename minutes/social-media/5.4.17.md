## Instagram Update
- Lubes and Suha have posted two photos
- Yesterday started posting Instagram stories from working on the projects
- Need to get people already on the Facebook page to follow on Instagram
- Might be worth prioritising more permanent Instagram posts
- Share a photo on Instagram and tell people to go follow the account - Rebecca will do this, Esraa and Mavis will do the same on the Facebook group / Gitter channels (CFE, FAC etc.)
- Maybe follow other companies on Instagram (e.g. ones that help people find bootcamps and courses) - Mavis and Suha will look into this
