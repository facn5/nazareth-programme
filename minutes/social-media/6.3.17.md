### Proposal
- All okay with the Committee Charter Proposal

### Instagram
- We have an account - @founderscoders
- Still looking to get password for Instagram account
- Maybe have a highlight of the week with a relevant caption
- Maybe use Instagram stories for extra-curricular things - useful for more temporary images
- Followers not so important - it's mainly for people to get an idea of what the course is like
- We can link to Instagram from the Facebook page
- Alternative - with Twitter things can link to the central Facebook page, and then be shared / reposted onto the Nazareth one
- Ready to get going with Instagram straight away once we have the login details
- We've created a Dropbox folder for everyone on the course to send photos to - from there we can pick the photos we want - people can also suggest captions
- Action point - Suha, Matt, Jack responsible for uploading the top images for each week, maintaining the account, and Esra will repost appropriate photos to the Facebook page

### Text for Application Ads
- We have a repo with a place to post prospective advertisements for review
- The current example contains catchphrases and concise information - a default Facebook post
- If you can think of another way to say this, post it as a comment
- Esra sees interaction on the Facebook page
- Post new info every day with short info about the programme and a link to the application page
- Suha and Shireen will translate it into Arabic and Hebrew - we'll leave it in English for this week, and Matt has volunteered to post something else in English this week - talk with Esra to get a translation
- Use this repo as a place to get translations as well

### Marketing CFE
- How to coordinate the CFE meetups without using meetup.com
- It's an effort to invite people to the event on Facebook - how best to use event platform on Facebook?
- Mavis: create a CFE Nazareth page which people will follow - invite everyone on that page
- Lubes: group invite everyone on FAC Nazareth page
- Action point: two Matts investigate the best way of mass inviting people to these meetups
- Shireen has invited all her friends and got a lot of attention from that - it might be helpful to just invite everyone in this way

### Video Coverage from Musawa Channel
- Shireen, Esra, Suha - how to promote this video?
- Maybe post it to other Facebook groups online
- No ideas at the moment - we'll keep thinking about it
- In particular it's targeted towards local applicants, but it is entertaining anyway so could be targeted at internationals as well
- Action point - Esra post it to the Facebook group, Rebecca will follow up with Hasoub - other than that everyone keep the video in mind
- Might be added to the website - maybe a link to it in the programme page on the FAC website
- Tareq will write it up other press releases by hand - the fastest way to get this done is to sit down with Tareq and write it out
- Rebecca will provide Suha with an outline of the info and links to go into the press releases
- Action point: Suha will do this with Tareq by Friday, and Rebecca will send Suha the outline by the end of today

### How to increase Facebook likes for the FAC Facebook page?
- Shireen has demonstrated how valuable it is to share it on your personal page
- Rebecca has shared to page with people all over Israel and asking them to follow it - effective, but a lot of work
- Most important for local people to work on promoting and sharing it with their friends
- Suha was thinking about the Manarah organisation - a press organisation who works with Arabic students before and during their university course
- Suha will send them the poster that was shared on Facebook - along with other links, the Musawa video etc. - follow up to make sure they've shared it
- Create an issue in the marketing repo with the title of whoever you're reaching out to - makes it easier to track
- Rebecca is in the process of creating active repos for committees - the programme repo is getting over-crowded - Rebecca is moving convos about marketing to the new marketing committee repo to solve this
- English poster has been uploaded to Nazareth marketing page
- Shireen suggests we meet once every two weeks for the next month, and then once every month after that - make sure we communicate on Github in between meetings
- Note that everyone in the Nazareth programme is welcome to contribute to these discussions as well - maybe share a link to the issues with them
