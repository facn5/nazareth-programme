## Outreach Talking Points

Feel free to use any and all of these talking points in social media posts and emails in which you are representing Founders & Coders.

- Founders & Coders is a global network of over 200 web developers - campus in London since 2014 and Nazareth since 2017
- We run a full-time 16-week course in full stack JavaScript in English that prepares you for employment as a web developer 
- Programme is open to everyone over 18 and we have no academic requirements 
- Programme is led by graduates who return to mentor, and focused on your needs as a student 
- All of the graduates from our first course are currently employed on tech for good projects - building a platform of startups with Arab founders (supported by the British Embassy Israel) and building an open tourism platform for Nazareth (supported by Tsofen and the Afifi Group)
- The programme is tuition-free and low-cost accommodation is available for students from outside of Nazareth
- Our programme is international (students on our current cohort are from 7 countries) and inclusive (half of our students are women) - you can “study abroad” without leaving Israel!
