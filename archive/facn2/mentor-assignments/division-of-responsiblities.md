## Course Facilitation Support Roles

A breakdown of the Course Facilitator role can be found in [this `international` issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/issues/57).

Much of this role includes the identification of mentors who are willing and capable of offering other kinds of support to the campus e.g. pastoral care, so that the running of the campus is distributed.

### FACN2 weeks 1-4 (to be revisited during week 4)
Given that @jsms90 will not be able to be present in Nazareth (at least for the first few weeks), we are inviting mentors to distribute a few more of the in-person tasks than usual, with the understanding that mentors will be able to collaborate remotely with @jsms90.

### Update
Due to a change of personnel (@m4v15 leaving) and a group retrospective on the needs from the role, some changes were made and new assignments were decided.
