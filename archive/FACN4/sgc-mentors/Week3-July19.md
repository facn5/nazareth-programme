# Stop-Go-Continue (Mentors) - Thursday, July 19 2018

### Workshops:

* Introduction to APIs:

    * Mynah:
      * Maybe prepare a proper presentation that can be reused in future cohorts

    * Shireen:

    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:

    * Ghassan:
      * some confusion about what is xhr and xmlHTTPRequest


* XHR Workshop:

    * Mynah:

    * Shireen:
      * remove the tools section (?)

    * Haydn:
      * Agree with Shireen and Ghassan - the tools are a problem, get rid.

    * Isaac:

    * Ghassan:
      * confusion connecting DOM with xhr request
      * confusion about what is Postman and why we use it


* Afternoon Api Workshop:

    * Mynah:

    * Shireen:

    * Haydn:
      * this workshop would have been a disaster if the students had followed the readme and attempted to write tests using QUnit - there is definitely not enough time for that and the workshop repo should be re-written with this in mind...

    * Isaac:
         * all went pretty well, students reach 4-5 steps in all the steps

    * Ghassan:



* Flexbox Froggy:

    * Mynah:

    * Shireen:
         * students not working in pairs
         * everyone had fun
         
    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:
         * almost everyone finished it
         * should be in the pre-course

    * Ghassan:



* Flexbox Dice Morning Challenge:

    * Mynah:

    * Shireen:

    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:
         * there was time to go over all the solution

    * Ghassan:
         * they were fresh from flexbox so it was easier



* Architecture Workshop:

    * Mynah:
         * Maybe make a PR with the README I created to abstract the info from the slides
         * Prepare a proper presentation
         * Giving the example of the todo list on the white board was very good

    * Shireen:
         * Needs more time then what is scheduled (at least 1h30)

    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:

    * Ghassan:



* Software Design Workshop:

    * Mynah:
         * too long, should be 2 workshops
         * make it a final product
         * fix errors in tests in stage 2

    * Shireen:
         * the pseudo-code example really helped

    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:

    * Ghassan:



* Waterfall Morning Challenge:

    * Mynah:
      * we should have a recursion challenge/workshop (Ghassan could write it?)

    * Shireen:
      * still hard
      * 2 pairs came close to solving it but still didn't get the recursion parts

    * Haydn:
      * new version went well in London apparently and the Gaza mentors/facilitators wer positive about it...

    * Isaac:
      * what was given this time was much better then previous versions of this workshop

    * Ghassan:



* Projects:

    * Mynah:
         * take more responsibility as mentors and go over the teams ideas while they are white boarding to make sure they have a proper scope for their projects (not too big, not too small)

    * Shireen:

    * Haydn:

    * Isaac:
      * they spent too much time on projects

    * Ghassan:
      * special circumstances, we had to do 2 big teams because of absences
      * checked with Ben and Denis to make sure their assumptions on what they could get from the api was right so let them
      go ahead with their idea


**Stops**:

   * Shireen:
      * stop being late
      * Explain to students that they can't leave in the middle of class hours
   
   * Mynah:
      * If people want to organize something its great but let the CF know before hand so the schedule can be adjusted

**Go**:

   * Shireen:
      * Tell students to google things
      * Always ask students if they have questions (Mynah, should we do the question box?)

   * Mynah:
      * enforce the 20-20-20 rule
      * create a ressource repository
      * create a library in classroom with reference books


**Continue**:

   * Isaac:
      * sushi on Tuesdays!

   * Mynah:
      * good balance between explaining and self-learning

**Action points**:

   * Find a question box (Shireen)
   * Put the resource repo in order and send link so mentors can add
