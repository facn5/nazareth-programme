# SGC Mentors - July 26

## Day 1

* Node Intro Workshop (Shireen, Ghassan)
  * Notes:
    * Mynah: I liked the presentation on node servers
    * Haydn: good reference for what comes next in the week
    * Isaac: people don't really get it at the start, maybe we should focus more on terminology
      (server, router, handler)
    * GHASSAN: 
    * SHIREEN:Liked the presentation as well, though then the ws needed a bit
      more time (10 more minutes), the general feeling was that people understand
      what's going on but still a bit confused on how it all connects.
      Great intro to servers! :heart:
* Node Girls workshop 1/2 (Mynah, Shireen, Ghassan)
  * Notes:
    * Mynah: Needs a solution branch, a lot of students were asking for it (maybe 1 ES6 version and
      one ES5)
    * Isaac: is there anything that could be improved in the wording or is there updates to do in
      the various steps?
    * GHASSAN:The workshop sends a post request using html form, and the issue here is
      not specific to this workshop, rather than to the curriculum where students gets confused about sending a request by the form, xhr or the browser, since in each case usually the request is handled differently redirected, json or static files respectively.

      A clarification about the three cases would ease the confusion, I suggest if
      that would be brought up somewhere, but after the node_girls workshop, since then
      the students should have had an exposure to three cases.

    * SHIREEN: The intro and this ws use handler and router in different ways
      someone should pr this (there's an issue about it already), this ws is
      great and doesn't need much other than what's already mentioned.

## Day 2

* ES6 Morning Challenge (Isaac, Haydn)
  * Notes:
    * Isaac: was pretty good, they seemed to have gone further than London cohort
    * Haydn: separates people dramatically, some people get it very easily, others it takes them a
      really long time to get it. There is a lot of reading, it's very dense... people here have a
      hard time reading so much
    * Mynah: maybe we can adapt it as a code along?
    * Haydn: could be a good idea, could be adapted so that people can get more of a practical intro
      to ES6. Also, the purpose of the functions is not clear, confused people that it was an
      implementation of a test function. People were tying to make the tests pass but they should be checking
      if the output is the same.

## Day 3

* Modularisation Morning Challenge (Haydn, Isaac)
  * Notes:
    * Haydn: its a long workshop, people wanted to get on with their projects and didn't understand
      how much that would help them. It's a bit over the top (ex: 2 home pages). Seems deliberately
      confusing for no added value.
    * Isaac: more of an emphasis on all the different components and terminology.

## Day 4

* Design Burst (Haydn, Isaac):
  * Notes:
    * Haydn: can we have the video to do the presentation on Tuesday?
    * Will ask Lucy
    * Mynah: Was the reaction of students positive?
    * Haydn: a bit confusing but in general they liked it. Needs a bit of context.

## STOPS

* Isaac: within project teams, they seemed to cut the roles in a very definite manner (frontend /
  backend)

  * Action Point:
    * Mynah: we could do a pair programming refresher on the various techniques during Q&A.
    * Haydn: also gitter and markdown

* Haydn: students need to fix their attitude towards attendance.

  * Action Point:
    * Mynah: We are going to implement attendance sheets, we are going to keep a track record on
      team work. How to implement this effectively?
    * Haydn: We can give Kav Mashve statistics:
    * how many contributions on sgc and where they there, go through github flow and evaluate your
      interactions and number of commits. Team retrospects, we will take notes.

* SHIREEN:
* GHASSAN:
