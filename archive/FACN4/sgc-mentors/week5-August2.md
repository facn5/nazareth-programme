# Stop-Go-Continue (Mentors) - Thursday, August 02 2018

### Workshops:

* Workshop on TDD Node server

  * Haydn: great, don't recall any issues.
    Compared to the other 2 wss this one was the most accessible, it's not that disrupting
  * Shireen: They were confused during the ws, but supertest is pretty straight forward and they used it well in the projects
  * Isaac: don't know if TDD and supertest go together

* Workshop on error handling
  * Ghassan: Was ok, short on time
    inconsistent approaches, the order is missed up
  * Isaac: the team I code reviewed had a log instead of handling.
  * Shireen: Was a bit rushed but generally good, everyone got what error handling is and when to use it
  * Haydn: impressed by how quickly they got it, would suggest adding what are errors, and what's the Error class  
    Ghassan's intro was really helpful

_AP_ Ghassan creates a pr to fix the inconsistency

* Node shell workshop
  * Haydn: super cool, people quite enjoyed it, Maybe add a line in task 2 about the fs module
    realistically students don't have time to get to task 3
    The ws has 3 parts where the third part is also included in the research
  * Ghassan: someone ran out of time and added it in the research :sweat_smile:
  * Shireen: Agrees with Haydn

_AP_ Haydn raises an issue and creates a pr

* Research topics

  * Ghassan: this week they did well, the Travis topic wasn't the best since travis
    are changing the docs but overall topics were good

* Build Request module mc

  * Shireen: Didn't google or read the docs
    do you think they understand how it's working
  * Haydn: not really
  * Isaac: didn't ask me any questions, one of the students wanted to build his own request module
  * Haydn: went down the wrong path for 20 mins and got confusing
  * Isaac: request was installed as a dev dependency

* Intro to linters

  * Isaac: they disabled their linters
  * Haydn: ignoring it this week is fine, as long as they spend some time on it next week
    Isaac's pres was nice
  * Isaac: will add it somewhere
  * Shireen: don't think they understand how strong linters are
  * Haydn: too soon for them to absorb it
  * Isaac: went around the room and had everyone add the fix-on-save option

* Projects:
  * Shireen: The team I code reviewed had a really good project, but the code was dirty
  * Haydn: the team style depends on how well they work together
    Team work is lacking
    The code was good but the website isn't that usable
  * Isaac: Was disappointed with the result, in the sense that they've done all this work last week
    The ux wasn't at its best this week
  * Haydn: they have issues on how they construct urls, not using parsing libraries
  * Ghassan: There was a research topic about parsing urls

**Stops**:

* Haydn: be on time for code reviews

  * Shireen: Agrees
  * Isaac: thought I had more time
  * Haydn: would love to code review from London
  * Shireen: be on time in general

* Haydn: stop being too helpful
  * Shireen: not sure
  * Isaac: love giving them too much info
  * Shireen: not help after hours
  * Isaac: write questions on stack exchange?
  * Haydn: It's a bit demoralising
  * Mynah: we are being too helpful
  * Shireen: enforce the 20/20/20 more?
  * Haydn: ask each other more
  * Ghassan: When someone asks me something I try to be really specific and stick to the question
  * Haydn: during the student project, I insisted we take a break and play a game

_AP_ enforce the 20/20/20
_AP_ be specific when answering questions
_AP_ suggest the game

**Go**:

* Isaac: they should practice how to write cleaner code
  * Haydn: tell them what format we want them to have
  * Ghassan: calling functions with a space after the function name
  * Isaac: now that they eslint, the code will be more consistent
  * Haydn: indentation, cs people are the worst offenders for writing css and js

_AP_ Talk about it in Q&A, tell them to look at the airbnb style docs

* Haydn: coding best practices

  * Isaac: don't write a function name before figuring out what the function is doing
  * Ghassan: the params and return value mentioned in the err-handling ws is really good

* Haydn: Drunk code reviewing :beer:

  * Haydn will do it from London

* Isaac: use more emojis in the code review :dancer:

* Haydn: tell students to stop taking too long of breaks
  * Shireen: if it's projects time, I think it's fine
  * Ghassan: if the team is on board with it then it's fine, if the whole team is aware then it's ok

**Continue**:

* Haydn: really nice presentations and intros to workshops :thumbsup:

* Haydn: continue what Issac did with design-bursts :lipstick:
  * Shireen: Yup!
  * Ghassan: it's hard to make such a video

**Action points**:

* All mentioned before
