# Stop-Go-Continue (Mentors) - Thursday, August 09 2018

### workshops

#### Introduction to SQL

* Isaac: went pretty well
* Shireen: was good but was too long, maybe take out the schemas?
* Isaac: could be, was longer than usual

#### Installation Instructions

* Isaac: went well
* Ghassan: didn't run into any problems

#### SQL Commands Intro Workshop

* Ghassan: the topic wasn't too hard, they got it quickly
  doesn't depend on other weeks, so they wouldn't face any of the old problems

#### SQL and psql Workshop

* Shireen: it had 3 parts but only managed to finish the first part
  Was wondering if we should divide it and go over the solutions separately

#### pg module Code Along

* Ghassan: think it was good, finished on time due to the fact we used the
  skeleton
* Isaac: seems like they got the bit about the queries
* Shireen: Think it was really good, but maybe could do a bit more explaining
  on the connection
* Isaac: there's a lack of consistency overall this week, with the way each workshop
  is written
* Shireen: maybe can refactor it a bit

#### Small Node app + DB Workshop

* Shireen: Overall they've managed to do it well, but not sure how well they
  understand the concepts
* Isaac: copy pasted a connection file, they're copying the get data all the time
  while it was an example, only 1 team had a post function
* Isaac: we should ban css for sql week!
* Mynah: can we force them not to do it? it's a problem that they're only doing
  html and css
* Isaac: the course is about doing the theory and understanding what it does
* Shireen: We already have the pr ready
* Isaac: they had time to do post, it's about how they handle the errors, what
  they do with the data

#### Database Testing

* Isaac: seemed to be pretty alright, but doesn't look like they've used it in the
  Projects
* Ghassan: one team did, they were confused about what `t.error` and `t.ok` are
* Isaac: they should know they can create bigger tests, you don't need to create one
  assert per test

#### Research

* Shireen: think research was good, they could have expanded more on schemas and
  migration
* Ghassan: build scripts and migration were 2 people and they were confused, they
  should have a background about the different types of relational database management sysmset "RDBMS", the injections was good
  and schemas were ok
* Mynah: it's a hard topic

#### DB Morning Challenge

* Ghassan: they get the heroku bit and the solution too
* Shireen: agree with Ghassan, they seem to understand how to work with sub queries
  but almost no one got to the second part
* Ghassan: the heroku part was easy to do but the queries were a bit complicated

#### Projects:

* Isaac: wasn't sql-ish, had 2 tables and 2 queries
* Shireen: the project I code reviewed didn't live up to my expectations
* Ghassan: mine had bad css
* Isaac: the point wasn't to have good css, there was a section inside the header
  an id of flexbox, use bem or anything else
  they had a handlers file but one of the handlers was in the router, they
  pass the request and response to every function, lots of messy code and not using
  eslint
  they should understand when to repeat code, they should know that writing
  queries in more than one file is okay
* Ghassan : had a hard time finding issues in the project I code reviewed
* Isaac: they only had one table, and no interesting queries, their idea was
  limited

  _Reading project spec_

* Isaac: maybe add that it should be a simple web app
* Shireen: Simple one page web app, have at least 2 tables
* Ghassan: In general when doing a project, it's  more enjoyable to be driven by an idea,
rather than by requirements.

_AP_ Shireen will open an issue about updating the project's spec

### Stop

* Isaac: stop pulling in arguments that aren't used in the function
  * Shireen: I don't think they know how to

_AP_ talk about it in the Q&A

### Go

* Isaac: be more proactive about using modules
  * Ghassan: research what modules are available?
  * Isaac: even more so, they should be using the ones they already know

_AP_ remind them of which modules exist

### Continue

* Shireen: Leave the students alone again
  * Ghassan: good for them to suffer
  * Mario : you're mentors not teachers

- Shireen: research of 3 topics
  * Ghassan: who'll choose the topic to drop?
  * Isaac: mentors will research one of the topics? we'll choose one of the topics and do it together
  * Shireen: ask Mynah to see if feasible
