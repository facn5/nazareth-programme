8th July - Biz Dev, 

Mynah: 

3 things for Meet-ups etc.


Grow the community in Nazareth and help get people to right level:

* Tutorial Videos - on materials in prerequisites etc.? Upload on a FAC NAZ channel 
* Promotional Video for FAC NAZ
* Hosting events - how many will come to first meet-ups? is there much promotion as yet?
* Info Sessions - need to be hosted by mentors, facilitator, students - there will be at least one a month
* Pre-course sessions: a) particular days of the week - not so good, b) mini-bootcamp… B - once month

Videos:
Yoosef, Denis, Matt, Ben, Nour, Mr T (tutorials only)

Event Hosting:
Yoosef, Ben, Nour, Denis, Suha, Ryan, Sol (mini-bootcamp only)


Discussion

Ben says: can we do stuff additionally to Kav Mashve etc.? uni fairs etc.

Ryan says: autumn course look for graduates, summer look for students around on holidays?

Mynah says: we want people who will look for jobs when they finish FAC, students are not main target… what about school students though, they are good!

Matt: are there other meet-ups around?

Mynah: Haifa etc. yes we should go and promote FAC at them

Haydn: remember the London podcast idea, also, the international students have a unique experience and we can promote that to others, also, promote to get mentors out!
