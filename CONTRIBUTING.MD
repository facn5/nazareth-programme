# Contributing Guide for the `nazareth-programme` repository

Inspired by [dwyl's contributing guide.](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing)

The `nazareth-programme` repository is the online home of  business related to the operation of Founders & Coders Nazareth. For discussions about Nazareth's finances, please see the [`nazareth-money`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-money) repository.

The Founders & Coders Nazareth community makes most decisions by consensus. Please see this document to learn more about the [consensus-based decision making process](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/international/blob/master/consensus-decisions.md) we follow.

Founders & Coders Nazareth welcomes contributions to this repository from all members of the Founders & Coders GitHub organisation. 

## Instructions for raising issues

### Step 1

Have a thought you'd like to share with the `nazareth` community? Please first use [the issue search bar](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues) to see if your question, concern, or idea already exists as an open issue, by searching for _keywords_ related to your query.

If you find an existing issue that matches what you were looking for, please click on the title of the issue, read the description to confirm it's what you are looking for, then comment on it so we know more than one person shares this idea/question/concern.

### Step 2

If the issue doesn't already exist, please create one!

1. Give the issue a clear, concise title 
2. Use the body of the issue to succinctly describe the task/idea/question/concern
3. _Link_ to any related issues or supporting material
4. If appropriate, suggest _action steps_
5. Add the relevant [`label(s)`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/labels) 
5. If appropriate, **assign** other members of the community to your issue  

**Sample issues:**
- [Protocol for cancelling or changing C4E](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues/229)
- [Remove membership.md from Nazareth programme](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues/152)
- [Expectations of commitment in student agreement](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues/165)
- [FACN2 farewell dinner](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme/issues/290)

## Instructions for creating/updating files

Founders & Coders Nazareth stores text `markdown` files in folders in the `nazareth-programme` repository. When creating or updating  files, please follow these steps.

### Step 1

If there is not already an issue open explaining why this file or update is needed, please **open** one and label it with `create-file` or `update-file`, following the steps above in _instructions for raising issues._

### Step 2

Create a new branch for your changes, and title it so that others will understand what you are doing (for example: `update-contributing-process` or `add-meeting-minutes`).

### Step 3

On this new branch, either:

Create the file:
1. Name the file (putting it into a folder if appropriate) 
2. Draft the text of the file using _markdown_ syntax

OR 

Update the file:
1. Open the existing file
2. Edit the text 

### Step 4

Commit the file and start a _pull request_.

1. Give your commit a clear title
2. In the _extended description_, describe what your PR contains and reference any related issues 
3. Assign (at least) **two** people to review your PR

### Step 5

Wait for your reviewers to provide feedback. 

- If either reviewer **requests changes,** revise and wait for them to review a second time

### Instructions for reviewers

- Closely read the PR and documents changed, commenting or questioning _anything_ you are unsure of - small things like typos are as important as bigger questions about the content of the changes.
- Request changes if you have questions or think something should be changed
- Unless otherwise specified in the PR, the second reviewer should merge the PR, as long as their are no outstanding changes that have been requested.

Please avoid merging your own PRs. Once the PR is merged, the reviewer will delete the branch. You should now find any issues that have been resolved by the PR and either
  - close the issue _if_ you created it
  - @ the creator of the issue requesting them to close it

## Copyediting

If you notice _minor_ issues with copyediting or formatting in `nazareth` text files, it is not necessary to assign someone to review your changes. Please edit the file and commit your changes directly to _master_, noting in your commit message that you have copyedited.
