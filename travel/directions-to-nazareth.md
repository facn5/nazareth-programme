## Directions to Nazareth

### Avoid Arriving on a Friday/Saturday

Public transit does not run on shabbat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown). Be aware of this constraint and make alternative arrangements if you're booking a flight that arrives during this window.

### Guesthouse address

Ataba Inn, Al-Bishara St 6, Nazareth, 16100, Israel

### Traveling to the guesthouse from the airport:

Public transport from Ben Gurion to Nazareth generally takes less than 3 hours unless you arrive during Shabbat or after around 8pm, when your options begin to narrow.

Google Maps is usually pretty reliable for plotting your route by public transport. Check your route before flying and don't expect to get through passport control quickly. There are almost always queues.

_Route:_ Train to Haifa + 331 bus

- When you arrive at the airport, withdraw shekels from an ATM. You will need this for the bus!
- Proceed to the train station located outside of the arrivals terminal. Purchase a ticket to Haifa Central (HaShmona) station (the line is called Nahariya). The train leaves every thirty minutes and takes about one hour
- When you arrive at HaShmona, get off the train and transfer to bus 331, which terminates at the roundabout one block from the guesthouse
- Follow signs to the Basilica, and you should see the guesthouse on the right (a sign for Ataba Inn hangs from the balcony)
- Note that if your flight arrives in the evening, you may not arrive in Haifa in time to make the last 331 or 332 bus. Check timetables before you arrive. 

_Route:_ Train to Kfar Barukh + 111 bus

- Purchase a ticket to Kfar Barukh (changing at Carmel Beach or HaShmona) 
- Transfer to the 111 (which runs every hour or so) to Nazareth
- Follow signs to the Basilica, and you should see the guesthouse on the right (a sign for Ataba Inn hangs from the balcony)
- The advantage of this route is that the train stops much closer to Nazareth and the bus stop is right at the station. If you are arriving late and miss the last bus, a taxi from Kfar Barukh will be significantly cheaper than from Haifa. A disadvantage is that the buses run less regularly and stop earlier than other routes. 

_Route:_ 826 bus 

- To get to Tel Aviv Central bus station take the train from Ben Gurion to Tel Aviv, HaHagana (1 Stop, train's final destination will be Nahariya)
- Turn left out of the station, walk in a straight line until you reach the bus station (a few hundred metres, its on the corner of the second left turning). Bus station looks like a shopping mall, the 826 to Nazareth leaves from the top floor, ask the driver for a ticket to Nazareth (34 Shekels at the time of writing). 
- Note that the bus goes to Nazareth Illit, so you need to make sure you alight at either Hapikud Junction, or the Big Mall stop (both should be announced), and after that it is a 10 minute walk to the guesthouse, although I'm sure someone can come and meet you! Also, both busses and trains generally have good wi-fi, so you should be able to track where you are fairly easily.
