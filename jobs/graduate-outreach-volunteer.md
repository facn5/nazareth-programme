# Graduate Outreach Volunteer

When a programme graduate has outstanding qualities valuable to the programme, in particular communication skills, we will consider providing a small stipend to graduates in volunteer roles, in particular when we have not been able to recruit sufficient graduate interns.

GOV's will work under the direction of the course facilitator and will mostly be expected to help the cohort engage with community outreach.

#### Expectation of role

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the volunteer will depend a lot on what the CF and the volunteer themselves see as being the most useful or effective use of their time. However as a guideline:
- The volunteer is expected to give **10-15 hours a week** to the role, supporting the less technical aspects of delivering the course.
- Expectation to be in and around Nazareth for at least the **first eight weeks**.
- We anticipate the role to require regular in person contact with the students, in the classroom in Nazareth, as an important part of engaging the cohort with the community.
- Note that as the volunteer is likely to be a graduate of the course, they *will* be expected to lead a week mentoring, as all graduates are. As part of the volunteer role, it is unlikely they will be expected to lead other weeks, but this will be decided between the intern and the CF.

#### Compensation

The initial budget allocated for the role is a small stipend for expenses, **â‚ª800 per month**.

#### Applying

Recruitment will be based on an application process in which the most appropriate candidates will be selected, based on the following criteria:

- Good attendance and progress during the programme
- Demonstrable capacity to work with and support others
- Willingness to remain on campus for a minimum of 8 weeks
- Ability to speak Arabic is desirable, but not required

We particularly welcome applications from Arab candidates. 

**Selection:** a panel drawn from the outgoing CF, the incoming CF, international management, and past visiting mentors (who have spent 4+ weeks in Nazareth) will evaluate people for these roles, conducting interviews if necessary.

Applicants for this role should use apply using the [**graduate roles application form**](https://goo.gl/forms/yMfj7qB5nwLIPLSv2).
