# Graduate intern

To support the next cohort, FACN3, we plan to hire two full-time graduate interns for up to 16 weeks each. Over time, we expect the number of graduate interns to rise to 4 and budget will be taken from visiting mentor budget to support this. These roles will require strong technical and leadership skills.

Interns will work under the direction of the course facilitator (and lead developer, as appropriate) and will divide their time between mentoring in the classroom, working on graduate projects and community engagement.

#### Expectation of role

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the intern will depend a lot on what the CF and the intern see as being the most useful or effective use of the interns time. However as a guideline:
- Intern is expected to give **40 hours a week** to the role
- Around half of this time should be in the classroom, supporting the delivery of the course, - mentoring, community outreach, administrative.  
- The other half will be for the intern to work on projects as a developer.
- Note that as the intern is likely to be a graduate of the course, they *will* be expected to lead a week mentoring, as all graduates are. As part of the intern role, they *may* also be expected to lead other weeks, but this will be decided between the intern and the CF.

#### Compensation

The initial budget allocated for the role is **$750 or â‚ª2,500 (or an appropriate intern rate) per month**.

Founders & Coders will provide either accommodation or an additional $100 housing stipend to interns.

#### Applying

Recruitment will be based on an application process in which the most appropriate candidates will be selected, based on the following criteria:
- Good attendance and progress during the programme
- Demonstrable ability to write software without supervision
- Demonstrable capacity to work with and support others
- Willingness to remain on campus for a minimum of 8 weeks
- Ability to speak Arabic is desirable, but not required

We particularly welcome applications from Arab candidates. 

**Selection:** a panel drawn from the outgoing CF, the incoming CF, international management, and past visiting mentors (who have spent 4+ weeks in Nazareth) will evaluate people for these roles, with interviews if the panel deems them necessary
