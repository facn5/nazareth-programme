# Visiting mentor

In the first 12-18 months of the programme, we aim to provide experienced international visiting mentors to the Nazareth campus, in order to provide technical expertise and support to both the students and the local mentoring team.
Current budget only allows us to accept 1 (expenses paid) visiting mentor at anyone time.

As the number of local graduates involved in the programme rises, the number of expenses-paid visiting mentors will fall. 

#### Expectation of the role

Volunteers can work on their own projects while volunteering, but should aim to offer a **minimum of 20 hours per week** in the classroom, and be able to be in Nazareth for at least 4 weeks.

Their responsibilities will include:
- liaising with the course facilitator to identify where you can be most useful;
- mentoring, including delivering workshops, morning challenges, code reviewing (weeks 1-8);
- QAing projects, giving UI/UX support or delivering workshops (Weeks 10-16);
- delivering at least one end-of-day talk on any relevant topic;
- contributing to cooking and cleaning in guesthouse.

#### Compensation

The mentors will have expenses covered:
  + £25 a day
  + up to £400 travel (including flights)
