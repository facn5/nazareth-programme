# Github Issues :octocat: 

## What is Github Issues? :memo:

A way for people to submit problems, get feedback, and collaborate together on code projects.

## How to open an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)?

## Things to do before writing an issue: :vertical_traffic_light:
- Check if there is an **existing** same issue.
- If it is an error or a bug, double check it, maybe its from your side.
- Remember that you can't force the developers to add something just because you like it, instead you can recommend/suggest it.
- Don't make long title.
- Using [emojis](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) will make it look nicer.
- Use good words when you want to describe something that looks bad(It would be better if you change X to Y).

## When I can open an issue?
Always, yes you can open issues for any reason. It should be well-structured/readable.
- Bug :bug:
- Suggestion/New feature :children_crossing: :sparkles:
- Code refactor :recycle:
- Positive feedback :alembic: 
- Design improvement :lipstick:
- Question
- Tasks
etc..

### You can have a template for submitting issues about improvements/bugs on your own project.
So people can use it when submitting an issue.

How to generate template or making your own:
