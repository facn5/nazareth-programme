# Nazareth Guesthouse :house_with_garden:

This file contains information and guidelines for the Founders & Coders guesthouse in Nazareth, which houses students and mentors.

The living area is a communal social space for anyone in the Founders & Coders Nazareth community and _any_ student, resident or not, is welcome at any time.

**Address**: Ataba Inn, Al-Bishara St 6, Nazareth, 16100, Israel

## Guesthouse Rules

1. Follow the Founders & Coders [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

2. :heart: thy housemates.

3. The guesthouse is a no-smoking establishment. :no_smoking:

4. Please don't bring any illegal substances into the guesthouse.

Founders and Coders strongly believes in self organisation by the students, and in letting them direct their experience on the course. However in order for everyone to have a pleasant experience some structure and organisation are needed, hence these guidelines.

The following information and guidelines are based on the experiences of the first three cohorts in Nazareth.

**It is advised that at the start of a new cohort the guesthouse residents should meet to discuss how exactly they want to implement or amend the suggested guidelines contained in this document.**

### Security :lock:

Only guesthouse residents should have keys to the guesthouse. The front door lock needs to be locked twice for the door to be properly locked. One guesthouse key should be available at all times in the guesthouse.

### Cooking rota :bento:

There is a **cooking schedule** on the wall for the coming week. Every day one or two people should be signed up to cook dinner. The people who cook are also expected to wash up and clean the kitchen, or recruit a willing volunteer to do so!

Up to now, most communal meals have been vegetarian, and if not, a vegetarian option has been provided.

- As a **resident** of the guesthouse, it is expected that you contribute to cooking at least once a week and sign up in advance so it is easier to plan the week.

- **Non-residents** are also expected to cook (and clean) if they regularly come to the guesthouse.

Lunch has previously been done on a more ad-hoc basis.

### Cleaning :toilet:

All residents are expected to contribute towards the general upkeep and cleanliness of the space. After class on Tuesday everyone will help to clean the communal areas of the guesthouse and the fridge to ensure there is no old food. Bins should be emptied regularly  according to the bin rota and taken to the big general waste bin by the roundabout. Next to it there is recycling for cardboard and plastic bottles. Glass bottles can be lined neatly in the hallway as someone collects these for us on a regular basis. At the end of each tenancy the residents of the guesthouse have cleaned the whole house thoroughly for the incoming new arrivals.

### Guesthouse meetings :memo:

It is suggested that a guesthouse meeting be held the first Tuesday of each month. Issues can be added to an agenda in advance by residents. The meeting will be facilitated by one of the mentors permanently living at the guesthouse. If a resident has urgent concerns then a meeting can be called at the earliest convenience. The guesthouse has become somewhat of a hub of the Founders and Coders Nazareth community so anyone, not just guesthouse residents should attend these meetings, although of course some topics will be more relevant to those living in the building.

### Quiet hours (Sat - Thurs, 23:00 - 08:00) :sleeping:

To respect all residents of the guesthouse people should keep noise to a minimum between 23:00 and 08:00 during weeknights (Saturday to Wednesday). Residents and visitors should refrain from playing loud music between these hours, and of course be reasonable during other times as well.

### Payment/kitty system :moneybag:

**General Kitty**

There is a general kitty (currently **the jar next to the water dispenser**) used to buy food and household essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning products. There is a chart on the cupboard in the main living area, where each person must tick the days for which they have paid. It is important for us to pay into the General Kitty in advance to avoid leaving people out of pocket. **When you have paid make sure to tick your name off the chart.**

At the beginning of each cohort, all residents should contribute an additional 100₪ to start the kitty for household supplies.

**Beer Kitty**

There is a beer kitty (currently the **blue mug on top of the fridge**). Payments for beer should be separate from the main house kitty. Beer rules TBD.

We buy wine from the wine shop in Marys Well. When we buy a wine we can get a crate for 240₪, residents can then buy bottles from the crate which can be shared with other residents and non-residents at the discretion of who bought it.

**Guideline prices**
+ Daily rate for residents (includes all meals): 20₪
+ Dinner if you're not a resident: 10₪
+ Lunch if you're not a resident: 5₪
+ Beer: 6₪

### Guesthouse parking :car: 

There is one parking space available by the guesthouse for students commuting to Nazareth. If there is more than one student needing parking, the space can be shared on a monthly rotation basis. This is a shared space with the shopkeeper downstairs and might need to be renegotiated at the beginning of every cohort.
