# Stop
## Using phones in class
* Particularly disctracting to presenters, and you are not learning.
* Arriving Late
* Not fair to those who are here on time.  We had to wait for code review today.  Some are consistently late.
## Using Laptops while someone is presenting 
* Distracting and noisy.
## Issues without explanations
* Explain, add a screenshot, reference to the lines of code, make issue as clear as possible.
* If you have a suggestion you can give ideas or a hint.
## Pushing to Master
## Leaving Early
# Go
## Raise an issue properly
** Can do a small review workshop
**Start using labels (bugs, etc)
** Accept others' opinions
** Be respectful - don't say someone else's work looks silly, we are all still learning.
** If you work on one part of the code, show your teammates and explain it.
## Have regular, daily meetings where you show what you have done and explain it.
## Communicate your code
* Explain it to your team.
Ask for review from teammates for each Pull Request/each branch.
## Don't surprise anybody with new code after hours of working.
## Don't make big changes to architecture without discussing. 
* Stick to the plan or communicate about changing.
## Do something useful with your spare time
* finish workshops, further suggested reading, etc
But also:  the projects are never really done, you can always refactor code, help your colleagues, etc.
The point of being here is not that you just finish the workshops, but that everybody is learning.
Example: We only used GET method..learn POST.  We only learned fetch, learn XMLHttpRequest, etc.  There is a lot to learn.
Be "present".
# Continue
## Keep making mistakes
## Keep learning
* Mistakes are a way of learning/working.
* Each mistake brings you closer to the solution.
* If you make no mistakes you are probably not learning (and if you think you have no mistakes you probably missed some).
## Software Design and Architecture
* Good topic to learn more about
* It is a must for each week to do software architecture planning.
* Will be more advanced each week with new components (server, etc)
# Weekly Workshops and Project
Intro to APIs - great
API workshop - great
Callback workshop - hard, some would like to do more
Event Loop (video) - bit long but clears up many things
Flexbox Dice - enjoyable and educational, very popular
Software Architecture Workshop - great
Intro to npm - we will be doing more with this
Software Design Workshop - great
Data Manipulation morning challenge - hard but important to understand
API Projects - brings the week learning together well
Some want to move code review to the day before so we have more time to make changes, maybe get ideas from other projects, or get help where we need it.
Decided:  Mentors (only) will do code review Weds.
