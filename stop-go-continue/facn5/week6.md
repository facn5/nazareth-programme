# Stop

copying code - it is a bad practice since the one who copied the code can't really explain it when the teammates asks about the code, so they can merge it into their project

The copying may achieve your dream, but in many times, it is hard to modify it or adding to it.


working on private repos - we agreed on this the previous week, but this week one of the teams did it

working while code reviewing - working while code reviewing is not really benefical for the one who is reviewing, because the code keeps changing all the time, which make it diffuclt for the reviewer to add issues, and also, inappropiate, because some teams won't get any code reviews/issues because the team that should review them, is busy working on their code

music - stop playing music for the group , its annoying and it disturbs the FACN5 members, or consider headphones, it can cause noise pollution

smoke - try to not smoke, its not healthy

# Go

Clean - clean the table, don't leave trash on the table, you should consider that there are other people sitting around the table, and literally no one can work while the table is full of trash

Focus - focus in your projects, your given tasks, alot of members are wasting time watching videos, hearing music, which is not professional, focus on the research, focus on your work, focus on being more serious, we have a professional project with AMDOX which we must deal with it in a professional way

Use english - some members, mentors can't speak arabic, its annoying to have side talks that in another language, especially when it comes to technical and work things, so please consider that some people don't speak your language. ( HIGHLIGHTED: TECHNICAL/WORK THINGS, side talks are OK)

20/20/20 - FAC rule , spend 20 minutes on your own, then 20 minutes with your pair, then 20 minutes with your team, then 20 minutes with the mentors, so members don't get used to asking questions on each silly problem that they can fix/solve without any help from mentors/other members

in professional environments, this could be really annoying and childish, so consider the 20/20/20 .

We maybe should have debugging workshop which we can learn how to track our bugs and know how to fix them without asking other members/mentors

Side talks outside only - it is annoying and disturbing for other team members, maybe consider having less side talks, and as john mentioned, we need to focus and be more professional, when you work in a job, you will be mentored for your moves, so you need to feel that you are in a professional environment

# continue

team helping - helping other teams in their code problems etc..



-----------------------------------------------------


White board DB - it was important introduction to the database and how it works.

Installation instruction commands workshop - it was good

Workshop on sql commands - it was very good, it had good information, it was challenging, I would like to have more documentation on how the commands works and what are they, we need resources on the side.

Skills presentation - it was very good

pg module code along - I would like to have a little bit more introduction on 'JOIN', 'AS' 

making a small pg app - it was good to understand how it really works, POST and GET with the SQL

database testing - very good one, it was fine and fun

Research - it was not that good

project - some teams didn't manage to have a full functionally website but we all learned alot, 
AN advice - focus on the real project idea, do the requiremnets then go for the additional features and stretch goals. 
work for MVP, then add your side magic


database morning challenge - it was really good and challenging one.
