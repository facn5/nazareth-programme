# Stop

### CodePen copy and paste
* Write your own code so you learn and understand
* Ask questions if you don't know how to do something
  * teammates first, then another team, then mentors
* Agreed by all.

# Go
### Large Group project
* So we can experience how it is difficult to work in a larger group
* Previous cohorts have done it
* Could be something we pass to the next cohort(s)

* Pros: 
  * Help us to learn a lot, big project

* Concerns: 
  * May spend more time fixing issues than programming
  * GitHub flow needs to be better or it could be very difficult to stay organized

* Possible project
  * App/tutorials/videos/educational materials in Arabic language
  * Open to other suggestions

* Action:  will discuss this again next week

### Planning
* How to do whiteboarding/wireframe, basic project planning
* We will talk about it next Tuesday.

### Short Sprints
* Can meet every hour, can make a list of tasks
* Using GitHub properly will help with assigning and completing tasks
* Group can decide at the beginning how they will work

### Understand your pair
* Everyone has different experience and different strengths, be aware and work together

### More Pairing
* For both projects and workshops.  Pair up!
* Some feel they cannot work with sound/speaking, they need to be alone, with headphones
* Pair programming is not about someone teaching, someone learning, it’s about learning to work together.
* Coding on your own you are in your comfort zone, coding with someone else you are out of your comfort zone.  Pairing can be challenging and frustrating at first, but it is a different way of thinking and working, which will teach you something new.
* It might be a bit less efficient, but you will learn more and write better code.

# Continue

### Git and GitHub
* There is a lot to learn about Git (and it’s not going anywhere!) so keep learning and using it more.

### Research projects
* Learn something new or choose something you already are good at and present it as an expert?
* Point of it as it stands is to learn it as a ‘technical spike’
* Post final in Research repo

### Morning challenge
* Topics are good now, like CSS, etc (as opposed to katas)

### Making mistakes
* Keep doing it!

## COC Reminders
### Be on time
* 10-15 mins early is on time.
### No headphones
### No phones and laptops when someone is presenting



# Workshops
* Pair programming intro: all liked
* DOM workshop: all liked
* Accessibility:  one asked if it was neccessary, would it not be done by specialist or other software in real life.  would have liked more time.
* Array methods: one
* Git workshop: all liked
* Morning challenges (CSS): all liked
* Research topics: some would have liked more time
* Projects: all found very useful
