Facilitator: @NickP123
Minute Taker: @Karyum

# STOP:

## Being late:

* Pavel: it went out of control, just stop being late.
* Sami: 1 shekel in jar.
* Mario: we said that so many times nothing happened.
* Neil: don't be late if you can't be late.
* Nick : there was only 5 of us this morning.
* Pavel: maybe just start being annoying on whatsapp.
* Hasan: just start when it's 10.
* Pavel: i was late cause everyone was gonna be late.
* Ghassan: let's punish people when they are late.
* Mario: this week is equally important as every other week.

## Taking time from building/prototyping:

* Pavel: we just didn't finish our prototype, the curriculum planning wasn't scheduled
* Shireen: If you're not on time then you will loose time from development.
* Nick: we were always late this week.
* Neil: how is it affecting you ?
* Not sure who: they be waiting for you and just wasting time doing nothing.
* Nick asking Harry about how every start of the day explained what we should do.
* Neil: I knew what I had today when I came late.
* Claire: not everything is about you though.

## Stop complaining about not having enough time when you are wasting it.

* Shireen: Why are you doing this and then complaining, we are not saying this cause you are terrible people, it's just cause it's happening and we are doing this for you.

# Go

## Create a guided workshop about Invision and Figma.

* Idan: I felt a little bit lost, if there was a more guided week like having more workshops, or morning challenges, cause i just felt lost.
* Hasan: people needed more time on prototyping though.
* Idan: maybe like a small task.
* Mario: i don't get it, is it about the tools or the week?
* Idan: cause this week was about those tools.
* Pavel: this week wasn't just for the tools it was for the thinking.
* Nick: Do you think if you were using the tools you will have a better concept on the idea of the week ?
* Idan: yeah?
* Shireen: did anyone look at the master refrence?
* Ghassan: it wasn't clear.

clapping for Claire and Harry for doing a great job :clap: :clap: :clap:

AP: UX morning challenge

## Listen!

* Mario: we are just repeating explanation
* Ghassan: some people have issues.
* Shireen : just listen and then ask.
* Nick: maybe put the agenda on the board.
* Pavel: that's really helpful.
* Harry: the master reference was updated only mid week so everything was changed last minute.
* Mario: It's also the laptops and phones.

AP: listen more!

## Taking this seriously

* Mario: I don't feel like you are taking this seriously.
* Hasan: yeah this week wasn't taken seriously enough.
* Shireen: no comment
* * Nick : maybe cause this week is different we are used to coding, and now we have no laptops in front of us.
* Pavel: people got used to program this program that, we are not used to thinking.
* Mario: you need to think when coding.
* Nick: yeah but this week has been different style of thinking.
* Harry: it's emotionally draining taking decisions.
* Mynah: We need to remember that we are here to learn and there has been a lack in open-mindness this week, we need to be more open minded when learning, maybe we are not gonna use what we learn but it's a chance to know something new cause we probably gonna need it that's my POV.

**Clapping**

## creative work

* Pavel: I liked this it was really good, i have better understanding of what we need to do next weeks. it's also good for figuring out who is out users it's a new approach we never thought of that i like that.
