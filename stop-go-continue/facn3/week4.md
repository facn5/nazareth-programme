#### Too loud in class during projects :mega:
- Mynah - normal to talk, little bit too loud this week
- Amir - its gonna be noisy
- Mynah - don't have to shout
- Finn - gradually rises. Reset by getting silence every now and then

**AP - get silence when too loud so everyone starts again from silence**

- Sami - too many wires on the table, its very messy
- Idan - wires are necessary

**AP - be on time**

**AP - don't bring up being on time next week in SGC**

#### Use google :mag:
- Shireen - jumping to mentors when you have a problem. More like industry. Struggle by yourself this is how you learn.

#### Raise more issues in code review :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Vered - are you afraid to raise issues? Your chance to learn and help others.
- Amir - don't want to be too picky about stuff
- Mynah - sometimes find it hard know issues in our own project and see it in someone elses project as well

### CONTINUE :dancer:

#### Node-girl kind of workshop :two_women_holding_hands:
- Sophia - really detailed step by step workshops helped my understanding

#### The great mentors :sparkles:
- Hasan - really good week. Tough on the mentors put a lot of effort in. We have the best mentors. :clap:

#### Having order during presentations
- Hoslack - let someone present before asking questions.
- Idan - personally feels worse. Nice to be able to stop and talk about questions in files ass we go
- Mario - I wrote questions as I go
- Idan - more time for presentations. So can see questions as they are raised
- Mario - I hate when soemone interrupts me when presenting
- Hoslack - if good knowledge know where to find the code. Note where you are asking a question for
- King - other peoples opinion on this?
- Amir - distracts me from what I'm trying to say
- Hasan - might get to the point you are trying to say anyway
- Idan - is it reasonable to ask questions as we go?
- Finn - present project as a whole. Questions on things you haven't covered.

**AP - see how it goes next week**

#### Helping each other between students :family:

- Mynah - really fun this week. I normally go to Hasan and then don't listen to him
- Hoslack - we are not moving as a team. Some people are being left behind
- Hoslack - I have noticed Haitham is not moving at the pace as everyone else. I didn't go through the code with him in the first weeks project. Is there a solution for this? Otherwise going to blow up.
- Amir - its very easy to forget about the other teams, I also feel behind and need help
- Hasan - being behind is related to the person himself. He should put in more effort. Everyone who is behind need to be aware you are affecting other people
- Finn - combination of things. Less experience when joining. High level at the start will help others a lot throughout. Take time to explain. Bring others up to the same level where possible. A failed team is one that doesn't understand the code
- Finn - pair, explain code, team working, review all code
- Haitham - I work at home
- Hoslack - can we give you support
- Amir - its everyones problem. Its not about perfection its about learning
- Idan - possible option for other students to do office hours led by students
- Hasan - difference between project and course work. In project every time we did something we explained and asked questions so we knew everything
- Idan - behind on a lot of things. Can't explain everything
- Hasan - at some point you are behind but its how you react to it
- Shireen - okay to struggle by yourself. Have check ins with team, ask questions, ask people help each other. Everyone on the course struggles. Be mindful of others ask each other work together.

**AP - students can volunteer to extra help for students**

#### Git flow :tada:
- King - so much better this week
