### Action points from last week

* [ ] Stop leaving rubbish all over the table
* [x] Clean the classroom

### Stop :santa:

#### External speaker talk was strange this week

* very strange, working and then the conversation started.
* went well at the end, but no one was prepared to ask questions

**AP - Make sure the speakers are prepared before the talk as well as students**

#### Laziness in the next part of the course

* reset after reading week, don't be lazy, be on time!
* forget and don't repeat

**AP - Rest**

### Go :christmas_tree:

#### Local job party

* think about doing a local job party, bring in people who'd like to hire us
* FAC job fair
* should be done for this cohort

**AP - Idan, Nick and Marlen will arrange it**

### Continue :tada:

#### Interactions with Israeli business/NGOs

* a continuation of _local job party_, do more networking

#### Knafeh

* Thanks everyone!

#### Being yourself

* just be yourself, in the second half be yourself to succeed

### Workshops

#### Express ws code along

* really important to get to the end of the ws but didn't, was important for the testing routes ws and then it was really confusing :confused:
* the ws was good in general
* all the steps that were copied can be implemented next.

#### Handlebars ws

* was really good but needs more time
* mentor should have stopped everyone to explain some things for example `{{{body}}}`
* explain what engine does, layout and partials during the ws
* explain what handlebars is before starting the ws

#### Handlebars mc

* was good and fun
* feels like things just happen with helpers, explain that point further if possible

#### creating and testing express routes

* awful
* set up took half an hour
* db doesn't work on ubuntu/windows
* bugs in the programme
* explanations weren't so clear
* pg promise is redundant and should be removed

#### research

* topics were really good
* was really important, might be better to cover in a ws
* promises was a weird one, did it before and wasn't relevant to express
* express sessions was complicated, don't understand it fully

#### projects

* decent
* was good that auth is not a requirement :sparkles:
* keep it focused on the LO of this week
