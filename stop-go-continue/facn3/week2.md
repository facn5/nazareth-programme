#### Discussed Research
- Nick - what about just having a discussion about the topics rather than presenting?
- King - Start thinking about how might present in different ways. All the mentors are here to help if you need ideas for code alongs etc. The more interesting the presentation the more likely everyone is to benefit from it.

### Stop

#### Set up of research sessions has not changed since last sgc
- Nick - just discussed this

#### Enough time to go over code with mentors
- Mynah - lot of time in classroom spent talking, I feel rushed when actually coding bit frustrating, not enough time to go over code with more experienced people. More time for questions and solutions.
- King - office hours from next week?
- Finn - we are here all the time come bug us we don't mind
- Mynah - can we optimise time better? Like group discussions?
- Finn - timetable is quite packed. Especially with office hours we can try fit in more time. Sometimes we have room to manouvre
- Nick - can we move things around?
- Finn - it is flexible to a point. But it is tried and tested which is why we aren't changing loads.

**AP - office hours**

### Go

#### increase time for morning challenge to morning challenge
- Pavel - haven't finished one yet
- Nick - is the point to finish it
- Pavel - sometimes feels like have fifteen minutes
- Finn - if you're late things interrupt groups and have less time
- Vered - takes a few minutes to set up, maybe arrive a few mins early
- Ghassan - maybe look a day before
- Finn - the whole point of the MC is to struggle and do this in pairs
- Neil - we're not on the same level anyway, if people want to get ahead and feel better about it in class
- Shireen - if you want to go ahead and do things but when you come to into class please be mindful of that because other people may not have studied this yet. You will have to repeat the same material in class

**AP - arrive five mins early**

#### Start at 9am rather than 10am
- Haitham - I want to go over things early
- Mynah - I would be up for this, more time to talk about code I love this :heart:
- Vered - maybe 9-5
- Mario - the reason we started with 10 is for people commuting
- Ghassan - people are already arriving late
- Idan - if students want to come early and learn with each other they can. Maybe Monday and Wednesday?
- Finn - I'm fine with that. I'm not going to do some hours but I'm not going to do lots and lots of extra stuff.
- Idan - just students?
- Finn - work life balance be aware

**AP - optional for students**

#### Tutorials online for going over things
- Haitham - I feel behind and want to study at home and want materials to study at home
- King - we have a few logins and JS30 is really good start with that maybe?
- Finn - ES6 heavy?

**AP - compile list of tutorials and give students password**


#### Mentors solutions to projects
- Marlen - I want to see the mentors solutions for the projects so I can see them
- Vered - can see them on Github
- Finn - even mentors aren't going to have full solutions and might not be that helpful each solution might be helpful
- Vered - you can see our solutions from when we did the course

#### CSS empowerment
- Hassan - weakest point in each project is the CSS, maybe a CSS project need some practice
- Pavel - I don't know what makes a good website
- Hassan - UX?
- Pavel - I don't know the basics of it
- Hoslack - every project is an opportunity to practice the only problem is we view it as a lesser task
- Finn - just allocate some time for CSS
- Vered - a few workshops coming up next week

**AP - allocate more time in projects to CSS**

#### After class studies
- Amir - I feel way behind this week, I need more study hours. Myself, Mynah and Sophia studied after class this week. I prefer to stay in class after hours to study.
- Hoslack - we can't learn everything in the group. Every individual strive to learn themselves then in group enhance it. Keep learning! Keep bettering yourself! To the group members who feel like they have fallen behind you haven't.

:clap::clap::clap::clap::clap::clap::clap::clap::clap::clap:

- Hassan - maybe for presentations

**AP - find out if the classroom is available for presentations**

### Workshops

#### Intro to NPM
- Idan - I think I installed it, some people hadn't installed it. 30 mins because I didn't do anything

#### Intro to TDD
- Pavel - was good
- Mynah - more examples of different kinds of tests
- Shireen - TDD or testing in general?
- Mynah - what about other context?
- Hassan - we used deepEqual in project not just equal
- Pavel - it depends what our knowledge is
- Finn - I only use deepEqaul and equal
- Shireen - different testing methodologies or frameworks
- Mynah -

#### Roman numerals code along
- Neil - nightmare, can get better at doing code alongs as a group. Spent a lot of time doing this could have the video as well
- Pavel - what video?
- Neil - there is a video in the repo
- Finn - its just the video of the code along on youtube
- Neil - people who want to do video and others who do code along?
- Hassan - I didn't like the task itself. Each time we went to another number then other number. Can't reach second step without doing first step
- Neil - different example for code along?

#### Fizzbuzz
Yesses all round

#### Dom manipulation
- Sami - didn't like this

#### Pure functions
Everyone liked this
- Nick - more on this?
- Finn - write pure functions from now

#### Traffic lights
- Sami - challenge was fun but more function after function. Was hard to understand prewritten
- Ghassan - intro to callbacks
- Finn - shouldn't be this week, move in curriculum planning

#### Project
- Finn - do you think the skeleton code was right?
No's all round
- Finn - only week we give you pre set code
- Idan - I sat with you about traffic lights it helped me but other people didn't know this
- Finn - I'm happy to go through traffic lights more with people
- Hoslack - skeleton code scares people. Write one function that works and connect it
