# Week 13

## Stop

#### lack of content

* Felt like yesterday was lacking, pretty quick and was done so quickly
* some people knew react before
* didn't do the project properly, didn't create the filter, didn't deploy
* Mario do you agree there should have been a talk deployment but there wasn't?
* there was!, you did heroku before and it's the same
* you could have done any project and not just stick to the instructions
* _AP_ plan well and add features

#### course from going down hill

* small stuff, getting in late, people missing from class, you guys haven't been pairing well
* I have a problem waking up early
* coming in half an hour late
* Given so much time and now thinking about leaving
* not listening anymore, ignoring instructions
* After you left us to do things on our own, we ran into problems
* We used parcel!
* in a job there will be no one to help
* disagree, some people already knew react and didn't want to participate, we learn things and then learn something else and forget about the first, no one got excited about a todo-app
* when it comes to client projects it'll be fine
* Many things we haven't covered
* Agree it's not as serious anymore
* people feel less motivated when others leave
* those who can help left
* We love you Mario, and depend on you all the time
* the switch between doing a big project and then doing a small one wasn't the best
* in the next project you can choose what you want
* one AP that we can have is to focus on one frontend framework
* did lots of tutorials and didn't focus on one thing
* _AP_ show more respect like we did in weeks 1-8
* _AP_ get serious
* Will be the same for the next cohort, they would have the same problems, maybe by the end of the 3 weeks mention that it'll be the same routine,it's because of the 3 weeks project

## Go

#### more workshops

* do more workshops
* maybe less talks
* talks were good
* do a project on the weekend
* I can study everything by myself but the idea of a cohort is to do together
* Learned more from the project than from the workshops
* we don't have time for more workshops
* Jack's article, he coded a lot on the weekends and then built his app
* every opportunity you get to code, use it, you're growing as a coder every time you code
* put some personal effort, don't be afraid to start a project
* when everyone is around it motivates you
* learning in class is limited and you can use it to some extent, the rest of the time you have to use it to work on your own
* go over react docs
* apply what you learn in an online course
* _AP_ practice and study on your own

#### more time for react

* covered in previous point

#### discussion about job opportunities

* start discussing what is out there
* Yvonne is trying to contact people but we should discuss it
* _AP_ hangouts with Yvonne to discuss it
