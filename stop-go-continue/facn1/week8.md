# Cohort course S-G-C

## Stop
- Last minute planning (typical FAC)

A lot of last minute planning even though the master reference had been introduced. Everyone understands that's what the master ref is there to address and that spending time on the master reference will improve this over time.

- Unfinished hard workshops

The parallel functions (as an example) workshop was very difficult. Introduce callbacks in an easier workshop. Workshops topics should be encouraged to be used in projects.

## Go
- Non-classroom space for mentors

Sometimes it can get a bit cramped in the room. Especially when there is a workshop/talk and mentors working on freelance workshops.

- Ongoing CSS workshops
> AP Intoduce a new CSS feature each week and encourage teams in their projects to plan the UI.

- Add FACN members to FAC

> AP Make sure the FACN members are added to founders and coders organisation in week 1.

- Before start of cohort ask what time they want to start and finish

10-6 was chosen because it makes it easier for people to travel from outside Nazareth.

- Try out workshops before giving them to students
> AP Try to develop a series of tried and tested workshops. If possible try them out and make sure the instructions are as clear as can be.

- Model code/project

> AP More examples of good code through code review or upstairs project.

- Discussion about selected technologies vs. unselected ones

> AP Make sure that technology decisions are explained in the master refernce or during the week.

- Week 1, day 1 install party

> AP Make sure the install party happens and make a point that people who miss it are caught up. Ask people to install linux before the course.

- Mentor hand over

> AP When mentors come, make sure there is a better handover process. At least make sure there is a conversation between the lead mentor and the one coming in.

- Diversity among team's projects

> AP Encourage diversity of projects. This stops the project presentations being too similar.

- intro.md file for each week (brief + simple)

> AP Suggest

- Mentor preparation

> AP Mentors should be more prepared for teaching in Nazareth by reading the SGC and having a one-on-one with the lead mentor.

- Keeping better track of SGCs and most common problems

> AP Make it clearer to students how the SGCs are being implemented. Before each SGC, read through the last week's points.

## Continue
- Master reference coursebook
> AP Keep putting effort into making this the best it can be. It's been really useful.

- Test driving workshops
> AP Try to develop a series of tried and tested workshops

- 12 students

People enjoyed having 12 students, but it was agreed that it could fit 16 and that people would not have minded it. The number of people accepted should be driven my the number of suitable applicants.

- Intagram to promote the course

> AP People think this is going really well. However, we need to make sure that things posted on the official founders and coders channel are not too silly. This might put off local applicants.
