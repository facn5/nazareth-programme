# STOP

#### Pitching same ideas twice
- Unnecessary - both pitches were very similar
- It did allow people time to come up with alternatives however
- Make the aim clearer - trying to make others interested in your idea

> AP: Make the second session a more formal pitch

#### Using half the time on prototyping
- Some don't think prototyping is that important
- However it's used in professional practice - it avoids mistakes and wasting time further down the line

> AP: Continue with it since it's an important industry process

# GO

#### Introduce user stories and journeys earlier in course
- We haven't been writing them in exactly the right format throughout - it'd be good to get into the habit earlier

> AP: Introduce concept of user journeys earlier

#### More mentor feedback on suitability of ideas for 2 week projects
- Maybe if the first pitch was more of a discussion in which the mentor could assess viability of the projects

> AP: More feedback, clarity is always good

#### Schedule etc. on Github
- It was there as an issue - make it more visible, but separate to the master reference if necessary

> AP: Merge the pull request with this info on

#### Brief technology intros / examples
- Quick code-along for some of the technologies people are thinking of using - mentors who've used them could give more insight
- What if everyone is using different technologies?
- Maybe provide a brief list of potential technologies and advantages, disadvantages
- There is also a pull request on the master reference with a list of technologies - it's incomplete and needs cleaning up
- Eoin wants to put together some useful stacks - plans to add this to the pull request

> AP: People are working on it already

#### Make the big project clearer before reading week
- The details could be clearer - size and type of app etc.
- Eoin: this can be included in one big document for the projects - spec, technologies etc.

> AP: People are working on it already

#### More time for research
- Bit of a waste of time having to rush through it this week
- What do people think about research READMEs on the whole? Good and bad

> AP: Keep thinking of alternatives to research READMEs format

#### Brief intro / resource on design
- Color scheme, material design etc.
- It would be good to introduce this - in the meantime there are lots of useful websites

> AP: Think about introducing some design to the course

#### Cover importance of planning
- Planning process could be covered more throughout the course
- Doing sprint planning today - maybe this will help
- Planning on smaller two-day projects is really difficult - it works best when you know your coworkers and how they work

#### More time for discussion and critique of prototypes
- Include some sort of user testing or something in class

> AP: Work in some time for user testing or feedback

# CONTINUE

#### Shireen's 'Idea to MVP' presentation
- Good stuff

#### Video lessons
- Worked well - might be other similar resources we could use throughout the course
- They're potentially less inclusive - some people might get left behind

> AP: Find some more suitable videos

#### Choosing your own groups
- Quite chaotic, but it worked in the end
