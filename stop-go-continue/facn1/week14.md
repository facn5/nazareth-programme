# SGC 25/5/17

## G:
#### during biz acc have time for students to discuss amongst themselves which P.O. they would like to work with
  - the accelerator teams were decided too hastily
  - could have presented our prototypes, and had a discussion among the class

## C:
#### 1 day React workshop (but better structure)
  - was generally good: some research questions, then counter, then todo
  - should have been more discussion/interaction/pairing
  - using create react app was good
