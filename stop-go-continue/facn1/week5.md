# SGC

## Stop

### Make SGC better
**Action Point**: No laptops during SGC, stand around and throw a ball

**Action Point**: Lubes will bring his balls

### Similar projects
- This project was similar to last weeks & API week
- Could be good tho to reinforce and combine ideas

**Action Point**: Look at node week 2 project

### Using emoji's during issues
- Good to make it more light hearted
- However as developers and humans we should learn to not get offended by criticism and in fact appreciate it as a way to improve our work/life

**Action Point**: Encourage, but don't enforce, use of emoji's

## Go
### More diagrams on the wall
**Action Point** Students should ask mentors after a workshop if they can make something.

### Group discussion about FACN1 Committees
- Not everyone knows about the Committees
- As the first FACN1 cohort it might be (more) important to make sure we as current students and future mentors are aware of them and what they do

**Action Point**: A mentor gives us all a brief run down of them at the start of next week's biz-dev

### Keep track of SGC minutes
- Minutes are kept in the Naz Curriculum repo, and action points are raised as issues

**Action Point**: Make sure we are all aware of This

### Move ladder
**Action Point**: Move the ladder back to the GH and bring a pointer for little old Eoin

### Move arabic lessons
**Action Point**: Move arabic lessons to Sundays

## Continue

### Learning outcomes on the wall
**Action Point**: Jack will write these on the wall next week

### Gitter messages letting us know of the schedule
- As a group we should know the schedule is on master reference
- Mentors should let us know if they're not going to be there when they're supposed to be though

**Action Point**: Students work off the master reference if in doubt, mentors keep in touch of any change we might not be away of.

### Writing module functionality before using the modules
- If we are taught how to write function maybe we should do that instead of importing a module to use that function.
- however sometimes these things are learnt but then forgotten and with 1 hour left to project deadline we don't have time to go and find them

**Action Point**: We will create a note's folder on Naz Curriculum that we can all update with our solutions to the Workshops to refer to. Elias has one that might be helpful.
