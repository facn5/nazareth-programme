#### More emphasis on planning - issues into joruneys, stories & technical tasks
+ maybe some people feel like that could be covered better. But having seen how that works, I see how that's a poweful tool. Esepecially in a project of this size.  
+ It would be really helpful to see an example of how this was done
+ I think Eoin just mentioned linking between issues to half the class? Jack picked up on that, but I don't think that I did. So I'm really glad that Jack picked up on that. Maybe that could be better emphasised.
+ 1 hour wasn't enough time f
+ 1 person in the team responsible for a whole user story (maybe even a user journey) helped us (team of 2)
+ This might prove more beneficial for the future. Maybe makes more sense if you're remote ?
+ We spent a couple of hours doing it at least, but it really saved us time.
+ If people are going to go into work with FAC and FAC uses a particular methodology, perhaps we should be learning their way of working? If all graduates work this way, or people in DWYL work this way, even if there are other options, does it not make sense to teach everyone the method that they have chosen, to all new students coming through this course?
+ Eoin didn't say "do this or do this". I don't know what the right way of project managing is.
+ Spend a bit more time on it. At one point, it was said that there was just an hour. We need more time for discussing flow.
+ We don't know exactly how we're going to do everything. So creating all your technical tasks at the start feels pointless, because it might change. Maybe raising issues as you go makes more sense?
+ How could we have made things more granular in planning?
+ Can it be taught earlier in the course?
+ Esraa: We suggested that you do it all the way through the course. Some of you just decided not to.
+ Maybe it wasn't clear how? Maybe it should be more than a suggestion?
+ Mario: Don't introduce github labels & issues in a research topic.
+ Jack: Maybe at the start, just introduce the idea of an issue backlog being your "to do list"? Rather than going really deep into every little detail of how. At least right at the beginning.

#### User testing at the beginning of the week?
+ I found it really good & I really wanted to change things after I did this today.
+ Mavis: maybe we spent to long on the prototype and everything could have gone back one day & have this user testing day before presentations.
+ I feel like we did the user testing of our prototypes on a Thursday, but then we didn't really look at the issues.
+ We spent 2.5 days getting our HTML & CSS prototypes ready. They spent 2 hours on Adobe & had 15 pages. Just spending a bit of time on learning/using that software would have saved us so much time & then we could have had something with actual functionality to do some user testing with. As it was, we user tested each other's but they weren't finished, so it wasn't very useful
+ Some sort of code review
+ It would be nice to be able to see each other's code or for someone to see my code. I know for a fact there are loads of hacks in my code. And I would also.
  + I thought the bullet points for presentations were really good.
  + We've really come a long way. Bullet pointed queues might have been really useful along the way
+ I'd say definitely present code to each other, even if there isn't time for code reviews.

#### Time to improve the app
+ It feels frustrating to do user testing and find out all this stuff that you could improve on and then do nothing with it. Doesn't that kind of lose the point of user testing a bit?
+ If there's user testing at the end of week 10 that we iterate upon over week 11-12, then maybe it's not necessary after all?

#### Ramadan
+ Start earlier so we have time to go back and prepare our meal. I will still be here, but I will be fasting.
+ We don't know what groups we're going to work on in May. I don't know if it's beneficial for us to decide as a cohort what we're going to do.
+ Optimal time to end would be 7.30.
+ 8 hours of coding while I'm fasting is really intense. I would prefer spending this time with my family, rather than being here for the whole week (The first week of 2 will be the most difficult. You need time to adapt).
+ Figure out at the beginning of that week, rather than waiting til later.
+ We should organise some dinners together.
+ Keep people together by working 8am - 4pm?

## Continue
#### Full 2 weeks coding!!!
(That's it - total agreement)

#### More independence with project.
+Being able to: choose technologies to work with, choose the idea itself, practice pitching ideas & choose which idea you want to work on.
  + Very hard to combine all those 3 things. The likelihood that there's going to be a project you want to do, people who want to work on it with you, who want to work with the same technologies as you. It's not easy to satisfy all those things at once.
  + I think it was good that we were given the option.
  + Maybe some people looked into React and thought that was doable. But I thought it was quite good sticking to smaller things like SASS or CSS. We're not exactly going to learn React in 2 weeks.
  + It worked great as it was. Some people wanted to exlpore things and some wanted to dig deeper into what they'd already learned.
  + I thought about the idea of learning React, but I wasn't confident that I could apply it in 2 weeks without compromising the project itself.
  + I think we got a lot out of these two weeks. There's a lot to think about. We're doing a big project for the first time. That's kind of enough. Doing a new technology at the same time isn't necessary. Maybe it's too much?

#### Outside user testing
+ We struggled with the language barrier. But maybe we were just unfortunate with the people we chose.
+ More time on user testing!  
  + (Jen: Where would you have fitted this into the day? How could we have tightened up the morning session?)  
  + Maybe replace the articles with just some advice from the mentor(s)?  
  + The 5 steps article was too focused on questions. Once I was doing it, it became clear that I needed to take queues from their user's own experience, rather than being so worried about preparing questions. They just needed to be told what they needed to do on the app & then have me observe.
+ We should spend time thinking about where to go & plan as a cohort! There was a queue of us going to Liwan. Especially in Nazareth, planning where we're going to go as a cohort was good but more could be useful.
