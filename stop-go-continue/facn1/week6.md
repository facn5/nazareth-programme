## STOP

##### Being 15 mins late for SGC
> AP: Be on time

##### Being loud in classroom when others are working
> AP: Everyone be more aware of this

> AP: Tell people if they're being too loud

##### Marginalizing lunchtime
- Workshops keep running over into lunchtime
- Sometimes it's not clear when lunch starts and ends, and people end up coming back at the wrong time

> AP: Be more strict in breaking for lunch, and make the times clearer

> AP: Don't be afraid to ask to break for lunch

##### Mario stop singing
> AP: Everyone be aware of making too much noise in the classroom

## GO

##### More time for complicated projects
- There wasn't enough time for this week's projects - however this week was unusual in being only four days long
- Lots of new material was covered this week as well - maybe this week's curriculum needs reassessing?
- Maybe need to think more carefully about having a 4 day week in the future

> AP: Think about adding some pre-course reading material related to this week

> AP: Some of the time spent on node last week could be spent on databases instead

##### Listen to Fayruz in the mornings
> AP: Play a Fayruz song at 9:50

> AP: Also people should be ready to start at 10

##### Put the whiteboard in a place for everyone to see
- The whiteboards are in awkward positions in the classroom
- It's mainly been an issue this week because the main one broke on Monday

> AP: If you can't see the board, ask for it to be moved

> AP: Try and re-hang the broken whiteboard

> AP: Continue hunting for the guesthouse drill (Tareq is in denial)

##### Cover config.env in database week
- It's a simple concept, but lots of people don't seem to understand it
- It's already been covered as a README topic in week 4
- Maybe cover it in the workshops, walkthroughs this week

> AP: Make sure config.env is covered in node / database week as well - and not just as a research topic

> AP: Try and keep your research READMEs to a few bullet points and simple examples

##### Real world examples of SQL methods
- Some found it confusing (particularly JOIN) - maybe SQL methods could be illustrated with examples, diagrams etc.
- Shireen's whiteboard walkthrough of an SQL statement was useful

> AP: Focus more on JOIN in the SQL workshop

> AP: Provide more real-world examples when appropriate

##### Change the time of class to 9-5
- Some would rather have free time after class than before
- Votes:
    - 3 FOR changing to 9-5
    - 8 AGAINST changing to 9-5

> AP: Keep it as 10-6

## CONTINUE

##### Trips
> AP: Fun. Do more.

##### Learning outcomes poster
> AP: Lubes will do it next week (week 7)

##### Continue Mohamed's mum's cooking
> AP: She will be cooking once per week

##### Outdoor SGC
> AP: Great, continue

##### Using the stick to point at the projector
- Shireen is a big fan of the stick
- Reem hates the stick

> AP: Continue stick

##### Working on projects away from the classroom
- Quieter environment makes it easier to focus
- Hostel will let you work there as long as you buy coffee - 10sheks for coffee all day

> AP: Discuss where to work with team members
