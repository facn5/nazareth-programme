# STOP

##### Not explaining post-course plans
- What will happen with the product owners?
- Esra - main aim of second part of the course is to work on real projects and get experience, build projects for your CV

##### GitHub flow on small projects / prototypes
- Is it needed for prototypes? Maybe for practice
- Still useful for bigger projects
- People can watch the issues to see how we work

##### Not having a schedule for weeks 9 to 16
- Worked well for weeks 1-8
- The schedule is there, but it's not merged yet

> AP: Put updated schedule on GitHub

##### People being loud in classroom when not doing work
- May have been due to today not being scheduled well - some groups finished working before others

> AP: More detailed schedule, and be wary of noise

##### Not preparing for programming on mobile
- Sometimes the Chrome inspector is a bit buggy displaying the mobile view - maybe just warn the students about this?

> AP: Maybe in general have more workshops about mobile development and Chrome dev tools

# GO

##### MVP contracts?
- Need to communicate better with the client over what's going to be in the MVP
- Maybe better to do it when we actually start on the coding
- Make sure POs are up to date on GitHub

> AP: Keep a record of what we're going to make for the POs - maybe when we meet with them early next week

##### Use a prototyping tool
- Prototyping could be shorter, using a tool - doing it with HTML and CSS takes longer, and is often a bit hacky

> AP: Discuss prototyping week - length, tools etc.

##### Teach us animation
- Could fit into a CSS day or UX/UI week -  workshop on animation

> AP: Think about introducing a workshop on animation

# CONTINUE

##### Noga's Designs
- Good stuff

##### The 5 minute talks
- Could be done more even
