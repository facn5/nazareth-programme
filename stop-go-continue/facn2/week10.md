# Week 10, 07/09/17

## STOP

### Fix Whiteboard
> AP: Leo will take care of it

### Cleaning class/bins
+ Mentors are taking it out (aka Joudy) - please stop taking it
> AP: Please take it out when you're scheduled to

### Stop Memes
+ Katia: Too much pictures going on in the FACN2 whatsapp group
+ Paul/MG: Gitter should be where more "professional" posts are made; whatsapp should be open to more casual, fun interactions. 
+ Mavis: Need whatsapp for messages related to getting to class on time
> AP: A little less memes 


## GO

### Clearer Description of Tasks/Explaination of Week's Flow
+ King: Very unsure with certain tasks this week, too rushed and explaination didn't make sense. Would benefit from a clear end goal. 
+ Vered: Agreed, felt like it was all over the place - inconstistent and repetitive
+ Mavis: Nature of pitching; but agrees that it's not efficiently done
+ Heather: Leading mentors didn't seem clear as to what they're doing. Would appreciate it if they were better-prepared.
+ MG: Materials are also very new to mentors; London was facilitated by people who wrote it. Nazareth & Gaza were more testing-grounds
+ Mavis: This week didn't have a very clear outcome - doesn't think that this is necessarily a bad things, as freedom of the structure is designed to help ideas flow.
+ King: Not necessarily saying it was bad - but from tasks to tasks, be really clear. Maybe use more examples that are continued throughout the whole week (aka use one app, like Facebook)
> AP: Should use just one overarching example throughout the week

## Workshops

### Group Selection Feedback
+ Mavis: Was this a good way to select the group?
+ King: Small things should be changed, such as having all the projects all on one whiteboard
+ Vered: Really liked, but better that the mentors give more guidance to how the groups end up
+ MG: London does it differently
+ King: Mentors should ask individuals about preferences if mentors make group selections

### Prototyping
+ Time-frame was perfect
+ King: Didn't think the scripting interview was poorly time; tired after end of prototyping

### User Testing
+ Katia: Very confusing
+ Yvonne: Should have a user base in mind when testing your app. 5-8 people are good

### Whole Process WS (Mavis+Shireen)
+ Vered: Confused with gift example, should change it to something clearer. Liked it overall.

### Research Day (Mavis+Lubes)
+ Good.

### Pitching
+ Katia: Doesn't think the expectation was clear as to what to pitch
+ King: Goes back to lack of clarity. Don't call the first day as 'pitching'; use it as time to generate ideas, then use the next day to actually pitch.

### Ideating (Mario+Suha)
+ King: Need more clarity. 
+ Please refer to "Clearer Description of Tasks/Explaination of Week's Flow" in the GO section
> AP: Be more prepared, should use just one overarching example throughout the week
