- [ ] Tell people what the guesthouse is making for dinner in the WhatsApp group

- [ ] Environment team will buy more whiteboard markers
- [ ] All students shut laptops during presentations / Mentors move to the back if they’re going to be on their devices
- [ ] Continue practicing 20/20/20

## Stop:
- Katia - stop the whiteboard from falling - the environment team will fix it on Sunday
- Lubes - stop working after hours on projects not as a team
    - Why is it still happening if no one disagrees with the fact that it shouldn’t be happening?
    - Paul is explaining why their team chose to create a new repo (to not reprimand Leo)
    - The project should just be everyone worked on
    - Actionable point: teams can only continue working together if everyone on the team agrees
- Amy - Stop taking people out during project time for pastoral walks

## Go:
- Katia - Make more workshop like TDD and Shot

    - Heather “Show us real life examples why this is important to do this workshop, it’s a way to pay more attention because we know we will be using it”
    - Stefano - “dedicate more time going over solutions”
    - Discussion on allowing more time for solutions vs workshop time
    - Mentor office hours: 1 hour after class

* SHOT TDD
  - everyone liked it

* ERROR HANDLING
	- quite a lot of reading / playing around but not enough
	- higher level of thinking but not enough implementation
	- mini-code along
	- action point: raise issues

* NODE SHELL
	- everyone liked it
	- Yay


* REQUEST MODULE
	- everyone hated it
	- gap between workshop and what we’re supposed to get out of it
	- 5 minute intro would help
	- No intro on the readme
