# SGC Notes Week 8

****
## Stop

### Taking class keys
+ stefano no keys at lunch time didn't want to leave the room open with laptops unattended

**AP keys stay in class or say on wahtsapp**

### Stop wasting time
+ don't have to be here till 6
+ wasting time on other days by being late
+ we aren't wasting time because class is until 6
+ mentors can decide if we finish early but we commit to be here 10-6
+ we can start on time even if people are not there
+ can we give examples of wasting time

### Forcing people to write on SGC
+ limit time for writing points on SGC points
+ discussion can stimulate thinking of new points
+ it will go on forever if we let people add points during SGC
+ discussion can bring about new points
+ hard to think up new points
+ people shouldn't be forced to write things on the board
+ don't like SGC find it confrontation/personal attacks
+ SGC don't have to raise issues but doesn't need to be confrontational
+ SGC should be about what we are trying to improve about the course
+ raise general issues

**AP 10 mins to write up some points then discuss followed by more time to add new points**

### Being rude in issues
+ be careful about wording in issues and be respectful to others

****
## Go

### Bins and clean classroom
+ have made the rota and no one is cleaning the classroom or throwing the bins
+ don't let the mentors take the bins
+ need some discipline it is not hard to do it
+ it is written on the board everyday (thanks Katia)

**AP everyone look at the rota and throw the bins on your day**

### Good vibes
+ not a nice atmosphere at the moment
+ the first few weeks were really fun
+ mavis is back
+ we have reading week to go and recharge take a break

### Demo of previous projects
+ need some demos as a guide for us to think about
+ Shireen can show some research
+ links in the presentation as well
+ projects after reading week

**AP some of the mentors demo of project process**

### Arranging trips for our cohort
+ Sajeda is going set a schedule with Tariq so we can visit lots of places
+ need to decide when and where we want to go
+ lets go see how knafeh is made
+ make some decisions after reading week
+ three places to visit and we vote the top two

**AP make some decisions after reading week**
**AP knafeh workshop**

### Look at past SGC
+ one of the problems of SGC need to focus on things
+ see which ones are very important so can actually focus on previous issues so things aren't getting addressed
+ are things not being addressed in SGC? 

**AP if want to raise an issue about concerns being issued then send concern to mentors later**

### Express-handlebars code along
+ good but very long
+ copy and paste from the html

### Animated css
+ medium not too hard

### Testing Express

+ good workshop useful

### Express handlebars challenge
+ too short
+ maybe slightly harder

+ topics later in the course easier to demo
+ presentations not necessarily the best
