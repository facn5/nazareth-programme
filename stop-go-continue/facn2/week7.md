 # SGC week 7 (17/8/17)

[we go over last week's issues]
- we need to let people know if C4E is not on over reading week.

what we didn't do:
- short talk on testing
- make things more visual

## Stop

### Going over project codes after class time
- Heather: tricky that people want to go over codes after class
- Heather: if you write all the code alone, then bring it to the project and try to go through it with your teams, you don't allow your team to experience the 'struggle', which is unfair.
- Vered: in general, I agree, but I feel we can't, as a group, tell people to do something or not. People will do their own thing. Agree it's not a good feeling.
- King: agree with Heather. The whole point of the project is to struggle through and learn something. The learning process is more important than the project.
- Lubes: don't bring in code, you can do work at home obviously but don't make PR's. And pair properly
- Amy: different ways people learn, sometimes nice to go home and think about the code
- Suha: we can't say any more about extra studying after class. 
- Heather: If everyone follows this, it's ok. But it's not a nice experience being forced through code. Wants a stricter rule.
- Heather: let others struggle
- Lubes: definitely be stricter in pairs. Tell the other to stop.
- Heather: it's difficult for the one who doesn't know the code, the other person needs to be careful
- King: hard to ask someone to slow down if you don't feel comfortable.
- Shireen: don't work on the project after class?
- Lubes: don't think that's viable.

> AP: you can go over code, but don't come in with lots of code and try to show it to the team. Be careful and mindful of the rest of your team. If you don't understand code, say you don't, and don't accept the PR.

## Go

### Bring Harry back

> AP: fit in video call with Harry

### Limit project time
- Vered: I think we need to limit the working hours we do
- Katia: agrees with Vered, but feels like I can do more at home than I can do in class
- Shireen: it's always up to the team
- Vered: agree, in 2 it's easier, but in 3 or 4 you get pressurized
- Lubes: anonymously submit whether you want to go home/ the latest you will stay
- Vered: agree but will be obvious who wrote what

> AP: in teams, anonymously say the latest time you will stay to. Stick to it

### Party next week?
- King: wednesday?
- Paul: "midpoint madness"

### Korean night next week
- Heather: going to TLV to get ingredients!

### Finish early when we can
- Katia: 1h45 on the bus
- Paul: we agreed we can leave earlier
- Katia: leave at 17:50 if we can?
- Heather: maybe not fair to make people not do work
- Katia: I am already missing a lot, getting home tired
- Suha: it only really affects Monday

> AP: finish early on Monday

### Time to reflect on events- maybe
- Vered: e.g. Harry leaving, maybe we should have talked about it, some of us were crying.
- Vered: as a community we need to stop and think about things a bit more

## Continue

### 20/20/20
- King: we've been getting better

### mentors' intervention
- Heather: we had drama in our team, thanks

### interesting research
- King: way better this week, evident in the presentations, first time people have been interested since the mini-projects (week 5?)

### cleaning classroom :)
- Vered: we made good progress this week

## Workshops etc.

### Password management
- quite short, didn't fill the time at all
- had issues with tests

### Cookies workshop
- bring cookies to class when we do this!

### Client-side validation challenge
- Heather: well-written, instructions clear
- generally well recieved

### session management
- King, Vered: a tough one (concepts were difficult)
- Was problematic but don't fully understand why

> AP: cast workshops when we talk about them

### research
- Heather: Leo said it didn't look good before week started, but it turned out ok
- Paul: demo'ing something to do with the topic, makes it more interesting
- Heather: adds more pressure to understand it/do it well if you have to show something

### callback challenge
- Vered: wasn't actually that bad
- same test problem, all the tests were passing
- King: would it have been useful earlier in the course? 
- Lubes: so was it a good workshop? did you learn a lot?
- King, Heather did
- Vered: maybe swap with a different one: parallel or traffic lights
- Shireen: replace parallel with waterfall?
- Lubes: we are discussing improving teaching of callbacks
