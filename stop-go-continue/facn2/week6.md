[we go over last week's action points]

## Stop
### Relying too much on mentors
- Mario: lots of problems are typos or "look I have an error here" where there's no error
- Mario: continue 20/20/20
- Paul: each project we get 5 'mentor question' cards
- Katia: disagree with Mario, sometimes she doesn't know what to google
- Vered: in general agrees with 20/20/20, but sometimes in project there is a rush and don't want to disrupt others
- Mario: spent 7 hours of his day fixing one error
- Heather: important we all understand that it is our responsibility to answer each other
- King: asking others is good, issues might be different
- Suha: doesn't want people asking, "if I do this, will it work?"- don't be scared to make errors!
- Shireen: look at other students' code
- Amy: do questions from students overlap?
- Mario: loves errors, something to google
- Amy: if they do, could redirect first person who asked to following people
- Lubes: doesn't mind correcting typos
- Paul: the more we talk, the more I like the monopoly money idea
- Lubes: might encourage students charging, undercutting etc.
- Harry: likes it
- Stefano: mentors should ask "did you google it?"
- Heather: as a non-english speaker, struggle to google the right thing, people can ask others for what to google even.
- Paul: mentors can be

> AP: mentors ask "did you google it?" and maybe give advice on a google search term
> AP: disucuss the money idea later

### Eating in class
- Stefano: A) for pictures, B) smells, dirt etc.
- Mario: agrees, smells are disgusting, Tareq opens windows at weekend because of smells
- Paul: is the smell all from food?
- Heather: no eating is not good, we spend a lot of time here, we need to eat
- Stefano: maybe eat strong-smelling stuff outside, 99.999% of places in the world are outside of this classroom
- Vered: separate "snacks" and "food"
- Mario: agrees
- Paul: what about bringing lunch and leaving it in the bag? This smells
- Heather: I think we're old enough to be responsible

> AP: be more responsible with food, nothing smelly

### Long SGC discussions
- Harry: self-explanatory, first topic here epitomises it
- Mario: agrees, suggests a time-keeper, 10 mins per item?
- Shireen: stops always take time, continues take none. suggests 5 + 5
- Lubes: makes facilitating much more important, sure about 5 + 5?

> AP: 5 mins max, 5 extra if necessary for SGC items

-----------------------------------

## Go
### Github emojis
- Mario: would liven up git workflow
- Vered: wants 15 minute talk to show good usage of it
- King: there's a markdown emoji cheatsheet, google it

### Cleaning duties
- Vered: has been doing more than her fair share, please be more responsible
- Paul: we forget the rota exists, what's the solution?
- Shireen: add a checklist on the door? (remove all cups, turn off AC etc.)
- Katia: tally like in the guesthouse
- King: whoever writes up the schedule writes on whiteboard

> AP: Bin emptier to be written up on whiteboard

### Assigning yourself to C4E (don't be shy)
- Just Paul and Leo haven't done it
- Everyone should be on 3 times

> AP: Everyone sign up today, fill out the schedule

### Be more clear about expectations from projects
- Vered: not exactly sure what is expected, sometimes aiming too high hurts the project
- Lubes: agile, start small and build
- Shireen: open-ended projects (creativity) or tight restrictions?

### Quick discussion re: testing
- Lubes: why don't do testing? don't see the benefits? Don't know how?
- Amy: actually likes it, doesn't know what to test, only has a handful of examples, has tried googling
- Mario: maybe teach it better, I didn't do it much during the course
[COMMENT FROM MARIO on the PR: "i didn't mean teach it better, i meant we teach it pretty good but they don't understand how important is it untill after the course in a real life project.
also i forgot to mention this that we might need to change the curriculum so we teach testing after actually getting a server and a database cause the student in the current cohort don't know how to test these stuff but this is not important right now"]
- Stefano: could follow the same trajectory as Mario
- Lubes: can we help any more?

> AP: some sort of talk/demo on testing next week

-----------------------------------

## Continue
### Using cups and visual aids
- Suha: was good, everyone enjoyed it

> AP: continue making things visual

### Shiryz english lessons
- [skipped it]

### Code Along
- Vered: I think it's great sometimes
- Paul: was moving between pages an issue?
- [Not this time]

### Practicing git flow
- Shireen: better this week, great way to communicate efficiently with your team
- Suha: continue raising issues on workshops
- Stefano: our issue is tediousness, is there a way to do it from the terminal?
- Lubes: it's not just about the admin, it requires good structured code and good practice

--------

## Workshops
### Whiteboard intro
- Good

### Installation
- "Bad"
- "annoying"

### SQL commands
- "Good"
- "really good"
- "yep, good workshop"

### PG module codealong
- "good'

### PG workshop
- "good"
- "challenging"

### research
- "hit or miss"
- "not good"
- "we can't even remember"
- Stefano: SQL injections are important and we didn't cover it enough
- King: really important stuff in research, why are we relying on students to provide it? Should be a workshop
- Paul: good for practising talking in front of people about something I don't know about, but don't remember any of it, get -nothing else out of it.
- Vered: agrees we don't learn enough from it, but disagrees that we can't teach each other something valuable.
- Harry: still thinks we should talk about something we are interested in
- Stefano: do a workshop on SQL injections instead of research?
- Shireen: research done well can be good and useful. If you're just reading and memorizing, not understanding, not good.
- King: realise what's good what's bad, drop when appropriate
- Heather: how much do you know to judge whether it's useful or not after 4 months? Sometimes it looks bad but sometimes we need to know it

> AP: Shireen posts links to MR issues about research on gitter

### db morning challenge
- "fun"
- "pretty good I think"
- Stefano: Could have been more steps written down
