## Late QA response

T: PR should be faster.

Mario: If you have a good GitHub workflow, it’s going to be fast. Good descriptions, title, and your team  actually reviewed it would go a lot faster. If there are changes, there’s no point in arguing. Make it a good point. We’re here – you can still ask us. 

Denis: Is it alright to come and ask.

Mario: I would like that, yes.

Mynah: I’m not going to be pushed around. 

Matt: There’s challenges with the speed of the PRs, it depends on the team.

Ryan: Even if there’s a pull request, I don’t like the arguments part. The whole point of a QA is to make code better. We don’t have to argue. We’re getting stuck as sometimes we have to wait 7-8 hours. I’ve been stuck doing the same PR a few times. The next step and review is being delayed as well – it’s hard for us.

Mynah: I understand your point. We’re not against you questioning. But there’s a way of questioning that makes sense to us. We need a constructive way of getting back to you, it’s like this for x y z reason. 

Mario: Your entire focus shouldn’t be on completed the whole database. You can go and work on different things. We need a good GitHub workflow. 

Ryan: It shouldn’t be in SGC that we should hear about this, we should talk about it straight away. Figure it out way before. This way of working isn’t helping anyone.

Shireen: Your team has your PRs done the quickest. I don’t appreciate you complaining. 

Mynah: We shouldn’t have to say get rid consoles logs and comments, there needs to be more checks between you before the QA looks at it. That will speed us up.  

Mario: Make sure you have a description, no linting errors, and let your team review it.

Ryan: Shireen asked to eslint it. It delays the next one.

Mynah: We’re all learning and trying to figure out the flow. The reply that ‘it works’ doesn’t make me want to review it quick.

Ryan: The better way is to talk about it.

Ben: In summary, review your team, QA communicate clearly, QA to avoid dragging out review, better git flow, listen to QA comments.

Mario: You can not listen but make it a good point.

Denis: Does this way of working actually work?

Mario: Everything will be very well documented and now I swear by it.

# Go 

## 3 QAs on each team, only 1 reviewed for merge

T: Suggestion for more QAs.

Bubs: They’ve just answered the question, we’ve discussed how to make things get better.

T: One needed for merging.

Mario: One request, one approval and one merge. One QA per merge.

## Working from different rooms

Matt: The rooms quieter with some people away from it. It works well to separate out a little bit.

## Useful comments from QA

Matt: I thought some of the comments were really useful and it was good to receive them.

Mario: This was good.
