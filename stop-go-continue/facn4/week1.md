# Week 1 SGC

facilitator: @MynahMarie

minute taker: @shiryz

## Stop

#### Cups on tables :wine_glass: ++

* stop using water cups and leaving them on the table
* doesn't matter which cup
* getting rid of the cups

_AP_ drink away from the table

#### Using plastic cups ++-

* fac is environmentally friendly, but we should have an option to use plastic cups

_AP_ Get 12 glasses

#### Coffee break @14:50 on day 1 +-

* a bit useless
* the point is to have a break, regardless if you have a coffee or not
* Work for 2 hours and then have a break
* set a minimum time before we take a break?
* it depends on the person
* it depends on what we're doing on that day
* at least an hour of work before taking a break

_AP_ on day 1 break is too soon, change it to later

#### Temperatures are so radical -+

* Gets too cold
* Matt disagrees and thinks it's too hot

_AP_ bring your jacket and sit on the appropriate side of the table

#### Moving from one topic to another ----

* We should focus on one topic before moving to the next one
* This week focused on toolkit
* This is the nature of a boot camp
* There is a lot to cover, can't spend 3 days on git for example
* shouldn't feel on your own with that, ask for help
* This week varies in topics

#### Talking during presentations +++

* talking during presentations distracts the person presenting
* easy to loose track

_AP_ Don't talk during presentations if not presenting

#### first pair programming task (ws)

* wasn't informative, better if you show us the slide. would rather if you go by yourself and then do it
* wrote code instead of fixing a problem, couldn't find a flow like the project does
* agreement
* expose the concept and make it shorter
* was too easy
* replace the rest of the ws with something else

#### bringing leeds fans

* lots of excitement :tada:

#### no phones in the classroom

* don't look at your phone during class time

## Go

#### Lunch for all +-

* once a week, we all go to lunch together
* make food and bring it?

_AP_ Tuesday lunch for everyone

#### Ensure material is localised +

* when giving presentations make sure that the dates are correct
* we're not in London so we should focus on Nazareth

_AP_ make sure it's correct

#### WS on css grid, flexbox and other similar tools +++

* did the mc yesterday, used css grid, maybe half an hour on flexbox so people would understand the difference
* there is a flexbox ws next week
* the idea is to know how to do it vanilla
* specify in the challenge that you shouldn't use grid/flexbox

_AP_ update the challenge and add instruction not to use flexbox

### Sunday starting late

* Sunday is after saturday, and everyone is tired
* 10 is pretty late
* not changing :confused:

#### one kata everyday

* should have a challenge everyday
* optional challenge
* maybe add that to pair programming
* extra curricular stuff
* a kata could take a really long time, be careful about what you choose
* in the evenings
* would be great if articles are also discussed, tying subjects to articles
* open an issue in naz-programme
* sign up to fcc/medium/...
* more in the sense of the week's subjects

_AP_ sign up to sites that send you articles

_AP2_ open an issue

#### Individual cups with names and fac logo

* discussed

#### on day 1 discuss everyone level/progress with pre-course material

* go over the pre-course material, so would refresh your memory and have a reference to what you need to know
* more like suggested material
* some extra for a Q&A on day 1
* especially if the international students and local haven't prepared in the same way

_AP_ take some time from day 1 at the end of the day

#### bash talk/ws

* how to setup your terminal

_AP_ Denis will share the resource he used

## Continue

#### Short + Sharp intro to the day's content

* really good to know what we're talking about

#### continue making the summer cohort ++

* university students can attend, unlike the fall and spring cohorts, will have more applicants
* agreement

## Workshops

#### Pair programming

* Discussed

#### Accessibility

* never thought about it before, now I know what it means
* good at the start
* should improve the semantic side in the ws, as in semantics and accessibility
* ws should be updated, some deprecated extensions
* had some problems with the viewer

#### decision making

* useful
* fun
* good

#### git ++++

* it's got to be about the practice
* great resource to refer back to

#### css gallery +++

* discussed

#### how to code review +++

* was the best part of the day
* code review was great
* be clear on not closing your own issues

#### Research

* Was good
* css (BEM) wasn't so good, because it didn't have too much direction
* a team of 2 would find it difficult to research a 4-person topic (again localise)
* presentations were really good
* the point of the exercise is to do it quickly
