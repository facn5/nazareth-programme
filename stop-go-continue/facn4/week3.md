# Action Points from last week:

* Matt: is phone rules also for mentors?
- Mynah: No, mentors need to do what they need to do, students are here to give their full attention

### STOPS:

Matt: No more missing classes
- Mynah: ACTION PONT: write an issue on Naz program (Matt)

Matt: No laptops during presentation, no changes from last week
- Ben: ACTION POINT: naming and shaming (Ben)

### GO:

Matt: have sgc every 2 weeks except of every week
- Noor: disagrees, last week was a good example of a need to have it every week
- Ben: having a conversation every week about it is a waste of time, we need to make them more efficient

Shireen: Google stuff!, stop asking questions before googling it first
- Matt: Maybe we should do a quick recap of mentor role so that we understand better what we should expect

Noor: Lookup suggestions, things that would be useful to research or look at outside of class
- Mynah: We are working on a resource repository
- Having a section with topics during stop-go-continues to write subjects that are problematic

### Continue:
