# SGC week 10 :keycap_ten:

## Stop :mans_shoe:

#### Day 1 of this week (week 10)

* Ben: the day of the design, to find an idea and find a solution, so day 1 to help come up with ideas is pointless and we've already been through the process
* Matt: it's important to have an intro, we don't come from the same backgrounds and the week felt repetitive, so day 1 wasn't the best to introduce the topic
* Sol: Felt very repetitive
* Bubbs: disagree, the course might have someone who doesn't have any idea about what design thinking is, so day1 was great to introduce all the concepts
* Ben: it could be really useful, it was vague, too broad and at some stages it didn't line up, and we could only catch up on day 4
* Matt: the gift giving workshop, design thinking basics and some more stuff were all really good and day 2 was the confusing bit

#### Shouting during creative tasks

* Matt: this week is different from other tasks, for example the gift giving workshop we were told to be emotional and for people to be deep so can't be shouting

#### speaker on day 3, move to day 5

* Tawfik: Move the speaker because we need to work
* Den: speakers have work too
* Mynah: a lot of the speakers come from afar and it's a work day which is more convenient to them, and there will be no workshop days, it shouldn't matter which day the speaker comes, you'll have to be here if you work from somewhere else

## Go :lipstick:

#### reduce day2 and morning of day 3 to one day

* Ben: condense these two and add more stuff, like 3d stuff and examples of let's say flatui
* Matt: the way you got us to limit our scope was really confusing, maybe add a scoping session, have a half an hour with the mentors instead of what we had. maybe add an actual user journey definition
* Jem: did you feel the flow wasn't the best?
* Matt: yes, the flow could be improved and be clearer instead of abstract

#### Air out room once a week

* Matt: the guy came in and said that the room stinks, so maybe on a night or a morning, to open the windows?
* Ghassan: or lunch...

#### guidelines

* Matt: pitch sessions were really confusing, it would be really cool to get some guidelines on how to do it
* People agree

## Continue :dress:

#### figma demo

* Ben: really useful to go over the features

#### prototype + more time on figma

* Matt: in our projects we've all done a bit of prototyping but this week we had more time and it was really effective to get everyone on the same page
* Ben: I wouldn't say more time on figma, the time spent was enough
* T: depends on the project

## Workshops

#### Gift giving workshop

* Ben: nice introduction
* Denis: didn't get the point of it
* T: you need to think about the people
* Matt: was fun, was really cool to use proper cutting edge material
* 3 yeses, 2 meh and Denis hating it :wink:

#### Design thinking basics

* All good

#### Project pitches

* discussed!

#### Compilers talk

* Ben: pretty heavy
* Denis: felt out of the blue
* Enjoyed it overall

#### Research learning spiral

* Ben: took too long
* Jem: given too much time
* Ben: yeah should be as efficient as the rest of the week
* T: should add more details, but was good
* Kinda good, most are happy

#### Secondary research

* Ben: was really useful and essential
* Matt: yeah was good
* All good

#### User personas

* Ben: more condensed, didn't find that too useful to have so much time
* Denis: we needed more time, all we came up with were 2 personas
* half are not so happy, the rest are

#### Surveying

* Ben: I think it was asking the same questions and re-verbalising the user goals
* Denis: it might have been useful but we were kinda sick of it
* Matt: the combination of them would be good, introduce surveying from the beginning, more concise in general
* All is meh

#### Point of view exercise

* Ben: felt like we already did that
* Matt: felt wishy washy and not really practical, didn't get the point of it
* Ben: felt like we already did it
* All is meh

#### HMW

* Matt: thought it was really confusing, we got to the point where we have a problem already
* Everyone is meh about it

#### Big picture goal

* Ben: would be good to introduce what are stakeholders
* Denis: would have been really good to share the structure of the week
* Jem: this week is relatively new compared to other weeks, so it's not as ironed out
* Matt: would have made a lot more sense if we started with the user and went down a more technical route of where we want to end up
* MEH!

#### Your idea as a messaging app

* Ben: felt like it's the same thing again

#### user interviews and user testing

* Ben: great and important part of the week
* Matt: would be cool to get people lined up to get interviewed, so maybe mention it in the beginning of the week
