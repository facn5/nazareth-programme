## Stop

#### Tobacco on the table +++

* Matt: quite a lot of tobacco left on the table
* Yoos: I've cleaned
* Matt: it happens, so no rolling cigarettes in the classrooms

* Yays: 7, Nays: 2
* _AP_ Tobacco of tables

#### talking during casting ++

* Suha: very distracting and wasting the person's talking time

* _AP_ be quiet when casting

#### Leaving the door open, Den & T -

* Denis: if you go out the door close it, I had to do it about 16 times a day last week
* Yays: all in favour

## Go

#### Use the unfinished sgc app next week -

* T: let's use it next week, it'll be finished by then
* Yays: everyone

#### Research always in order +

* Ryan: Decided we'll have the sticks picked before, but the topics depend on each other, we talked about https and then moved to a related topic
* Mynah: they're independent topics and shouldn't depend on each other
* Shireen: we'll look at next week's and think about it

#### Allow hot foods in the class again -+

* Denis: It feels like my fault, hard for me to see Ben's face like that
* Shireen: the classroom feels cleaner
* Yays: 3, Nays: the rest

#### Cleaning inside and out

* Matt: It will be cool if we clean inside and out, the ac has been sitting outside for weeks
* Yoos: outside is not just our responsibility
* Matt: but it'll be nice
* Noor: it'll show we're dedicated
* Mynah: don't throw away anything before checking
* Yays: majority

#### Lan party - Den

* Let's have a lan party, maybe here tonight after the deep clean
* Some confused faces
* Some really happy geeks

#### The mentors in a known area Wednesday morning

* Denis: we looked for you last week, we had a problem and didn't know where anyone is, maybe check whatsapp and be available close by
* Mentors: no problem

## Continue

#### Short snappy pres of projects +++

* Matt: I think this week's presentations were great
* Den: yeah we're improving each week

## Workshops

#### Presentation on pass management

* Mostly happy 1 meh
* Matt: was really cool to have fresh ppl presenting

#### ws on password management

* All hands jazzy, 2 people not happy
* Really short, maybe add more content
* or create a new ws

#### cookies ws

* 2 not great, rest is good
* too short

#### client side validsation mc

* good but without the css part
* in several places, stressed the css part and we all spent time on that
* should have told us to do the dom without missing around
* split vote between good and not good

#### stateless session management

* 5 good

#### research

* really tough
* yeah was quite hard
* 7 up

#### promises mc

* think we should practice promises more, the challenge isn't enough
* agree, was too short for what it is, could do less time on cookies and more time on promises
* 4 up, 0 down and 5 medium

#### projects

* the suggestion of building on a previous project wasn't helpful, too much emphasis on that
* Jem: we stayed in the same team and that's why it was good
* Agree with Jem, I assumed we're staying in the same group, it's hard to understand the other team's project or explain your code to other people
* It took a lot of time to finish this project and wrote lots of code
* Don't think it was mandatory but optional, only one team did it, think that for doing it for the first time it was hard but good
* Working in the industry would mean that we'll work with other people's code but not now
* Ghassan : worked with other people's code and it had 80 files, had to read it and know what to do and where to add my code

#### school trip

* Almost everyone really happy, 1 not so much
* it was a kids' trip
* Lots to learn from the museum
* Was it educational or entertainment
* Mynah :sparkles:: it was an invitation from Waleed and the ncta, so we wanted to show good faith and we have a responsibility to make our partners happy and it would have been really rude to decline
