# SGC week8

## Stop

#### Leaving the class early

* Suha: Noticed that when it's time to present projects, some of the team members have left, I feel that does affect other people as well
* Ben: hard to disagree
* Suha: might sometimes have special reasons to leave, but you're not gonna have an excuse every time

## Go

#### Everyone has to present, please!

* Jem: It's a reoccurring thing, some people don't present, but it's a responsibility for everyone to present

## Continue

* Denis didn't like it but for
* Ben: sessions weren't really clear on what we should research
* Suha: took Mynah 2 hours to show us a research about attacks, and takes us half an hour, if we really want to get the idea behind research we need more time to research,

* People were generally happy

#### Projects

* Denis: cutting the days off, got everyone stressed, it wasn't great
* Yoos: we usually separate the tasks, we should stick to the tasks that we assigned in the beginning, it would be better if each person sticks to his part of the project, then if someone doesn't complete his part then someone can help me with it
* Matt: try to split the work in the beginning and then work with that plan
