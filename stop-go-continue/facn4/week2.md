## Stop :no_entry_sign:

#### Videos :cinema: ++

* We showed the video, but prefer to watch it alone, the event loop video was really long
* the timing of the video is important, maybe after a ws, instead of end of the day
* The idea is to have a break while watching it
* The subject of the video was really hard to understand, combine it with the fact that it's the end of the day and it was too much
* if anyone feels like finding a better intro to the event loop video, please do :smile:
* Maybe add a background intro
* the fun fun functions video was really helpful

#### Weekly SGC ---

* I'm a bit surprised that we're doing one today, since we already had a sgc last week, too frequent
* Not gonna change, it's to help you when you need to get feedback when reviewing the curriculum
* is it about the form of feedback?
* nope, just the frequency

#### Looking at phones during presentations :no_mobile_phones: ++-

* Agreement

_AP_ Phones are not allowed during presentations

#### Giving too much time for presentation :clock1: +++-

* Don't think we need 20 mins for one presentation, got repetitive and pointless, we'd rather spend another half an hour on projects
* It's not about delivering new info, it's about practicing presenting
* Agree with Rayan, but soon enough the code will be very different than other teams
* There are many tricks we can use during presentations, that would help the person presenting to give a compelling presentation

_AP_ give a template to what should be included in a presentation

* lots of comments after presenting which we don't want to cut as well

## Go :running:

#### More time working on projects ++--

* One more day to work, feels short
* Don't think it'll happen
* Every day we take away from projects is a day taken out of learning tools and new things
* Maybe a hybrid of the two, the things you learn in the beginning of the week, we implement it at the end of that ws
* Two days are enough to do it
* Maybe start working on the projects while learning, not sure it's a good idea
* it's not about completing a finished product but practicing the materials of the week, not the final result. you're free to fork the project and work more
* Looking at the Gaza project, they uploaded their presentation to a hackmd (research)

#### Design bursts :lipstick::fire:

* London is starting half an hour design bursts, they're talks with Noga and Max, they're small challenges that you're required to implement in the projects
* It's half an hour and very useful
* Not a live stream
* One week after London

#### Revision club :bulb:

* Gaza students would like to form a revision club, so they can revise together
* The initial idea is to have people on-line helping each other
* Atom/VSCode do have a collaborative option, would be cool to try it out
* Lots of cool ideas
* Maybe a monday with C4E
* Noor would like to do it, a good way for applicants to see what we're doing

#### Office hours :office:

* 9 to 10
* Two days a week?
* Think it's worth it
* Lots of us feel like they have a lot to catch up on
* Find a structure for it, the mentors should know if people are going to show up
* The default would be that there aren't office hours unless someone asks
* Have a sign up sheet
* Maybe a Wednesday or a Thursday, project days after we've learned and tried it
* Wednesday/Thursday morning, Wednesday evening
* If you send it in the group then everyone would know

#### Decisions to be made by show of hands

* Use hand gestures :open_hands:

## Continue :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

#### The walks +++ :walking:

* Like the walks, were good
* Haydn loved his walks
* More walks?
* depends
* Quite good

#### Live coding (casting) ++

* The intro to cbs, typing on repl and people get to focus on the code
* The mentors could do a code along, once a week during the Q&A :question:

#### code along -

* The roman numerals, Am I the only one who liked it?
* Had lots of typos so it took a lot of time
* Really simple code, Would have been nice to see what it looks like and type it
* It's hard since it's the first code-along, it has a learning curve, so it gets messy
* Give it a chance!
* Was it obnoxious?
* Not really
* All Jazzy :dancer:

#### More posters :pencil:

* hang things on the wall
* find resources

_AP_ if you feel like you need some more posters around, prepare it and we can print it

* If you want it now, you'll definitely want it in the following weeks
* Make it available on a git repo
* Joint repo :tada:

## Schedule

#### fizzbuzz tape ws ++

* Almost everyone liked it

#### Roman numerals +-

* covered
* Split votes :smile::confused:

#### Dom manipulation ++

* Half good/Half not so good

#### Pure functions ws +

#### research ++-

* Prioritise creating a hackmd and not a power point
* You'll have to sacrifice one of the tools, a hackmd can do both.
* Reading the London and Gaza's research was really quick and helpful
* 3 not sure, the rest thought it wasn't good

#### event loop video ---

* Lots of hate :broken_heart:

#### intro to callbacks +++

* Tricky but good
* 1 not good, rest is happy

#### projects ++

* good and meh, split half and half
* Really good practice

#### traffic lights mc +++ :traffic_light:

* 1 not good, rest is happy
* Didn't know lots about cbs so felt like I was behind and didn't understand what to do
* Felt like people were more prepared
