# Workshops:

**ES6 Classes** - Great

**Reactive Rendering Challenge**- No comments

**Modern Frontend -** Very good, Amazing

**React API -** Very good

**Build a stopwatch -** We didn't do it as we had a discussion instead.

**Destructuring morning challenge -** All good

**Bundlers -** Meh, no clear takeaways

**React dynamic data -** hard but really useful

**React components -** Testing with jest - Good

**Thinking in react** - Good

**Project set-up** - Not clear why you would choose one over the other

**This morning challenge** - Good

**Projects** - Good. All projects should be more focused on the topic of the week rather than of past weeks. Would be nice to get information on the file structure and logic before the project, as React is a new library.

**External Speaker** - Good.
