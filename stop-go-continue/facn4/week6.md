# Stop

###### Opening window, especially in presentations:

**Matt:** It's annoying people messying with the window.
\_**\_AP:\_\_** No messing with the window.

###### Variance in mentor numbers:

**Matt:**Sometimes there's none, sometimes there are too many. </br>
**Shireen:** We're not your baby sitters.</br>
**Matt:** I get your point. Please be at least 1 mentor.</br>
**Ben:** There's no such thing as too many mentors. </br>
**Mynah:** You need to be more adaptable. In the real world you need to be. FAC is not a cushioned bubble, because real life isn't. </br>
**Matt:** Thinks the mentor have not been respectful. </br>
**Mynah:** This shouldn't be a general issue. I think Matt's comment is unfair. </br>
**Ryan:** I thought it was great the mentor not being there. We had to work stuff out our self. </br>
**Denis:** I read the mentors responsibilities, and they all go beyond their requirements. </br>

###### Bringing smelly food to class:

\_**\_AP:\_\_** Only snack allowed.

###### Not being serious during project presentations:

**Ryan:** The least we can do in presentations is take them seriously. Less laughing, please.</br>
**Matt:** Code can be boring. It can also be good to have character/honesty in presentations.</br>
**Mynah:** Code isn't boring, it's the most exciting part. It's cool that we all understand each other and appreciate the code. </br>
**Sol:** Less repeating in presentation.</br>
**Matt:** Try cover new material.</br>
**Shireen:** I was disappointed how similar the project this week were to last week. </br>

# Go

###### Class deep clean:

**AP:** Deep clean every Sunday by all.

###### Clean up each night:

**AP:** Sign up to cleaning rota.

###### Explain code and method during pair programming:

**Suha:** I sometimes don't understand stuff in pair programming. </br>
**Ryan:** Ask questions. It's hard to know if someone doesn't understand. </br>
**Shireen:** Please ask if you don't understand something.</br>
**Gassan:** When pairing, the one who understands less should type.</br>

###### Get out of class to code during projects:

**Ryan:** I think its a good idea.</br>
**Mario:** Google is smarter than me and every other mentor. You can work from a cafe </br>

###### Continue Q&A?

**Shireen:** I was wondering if it's useful. Is it beneficial.</br>
**Ben:** Sometimes they're useful, but usually not.</br>
**Matt:** It could be optional, so people can leave early.</br>
**Mynah:** They're not optional. It's either Bizz dev or Q&A. Q&A can be useful for the mentors to understand what level everyone is.</br>
**AP:** Q&A will be half an hour, and if no more is required people will return to Bizzdev.</br>

###### 3 Topics research

**Shireen:** The mentor should take research topic to 'show how it should be done'. </br>
**Ben:** You think your better at google searching?</br>
**Shireen:** Yeah</br>
**Sol:** Were you this good when you started?</br>
**Ryan:** Everyone calm down, the point is the idea about the mentors researching.</br>
**Mynah:** Maybe it's a good idea but we need to think about it.</br>
**AP:** Mentors will discuss it

# Workshops

1.  **Databse Walkthrough:**</br>
    Everyone loved it.

2.  **SQL Intro & Installation:**</br>
    Loved it.

3.  **Complex SQL Command:**</br>
    **Ryan:** Great project, maybe need more time for it. Maybe go through the basics with a mentor, and then do intermendiate in pairs.</br>
    **Shireen:** Shorten the basics part of the workshop to give more time to the intermediate.</br>
    **AP:** Shorten the basics section

4.  **PG Code Along:**</br>
    Everyone thinks it was great and fun.</br>

5.  **Setup DB using node:** </br>
    **Denis:** They were similar so its hard to remember them individually.</br>

6.  **DB Testing:**</br>
    **Matt:** Workshop was good but it wasn't very helpful for the project.</br>
    **Denis:** The workshop needs editting.
    Everyone though it was okay.. but not great.
    **AP:** Have workshop include Travis, and answer if build.js should be self executing.</br>

7.  **Day 3 MC-DB on Heroku:** </br>
    Everyone though it was 'fine'</br>
8.  **Research:**</br>
    **Ryan:** Great having three Topics</br>
    **Suha:** It ws also good because the research topics all had a 'mission', ie draw a schema. </br>
    **Shireen:** You can deviate from the examples on github and do a mini project for your research.</br>
    Everyone thought it was great.

    **Mynah:** Get out of your comfort zone. </br>
    **Denis:** How can we chop it up more, what are we doing that is similar. </br>
    **Ryan:** The projects are always a race against time. People get into the mentality of we need to finish the project. </br>

    **Ryan:** To the mentor: Please point it out if we are missing the point on the projects.</br>
