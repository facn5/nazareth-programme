# Action points from last week:

* Use the shut up method

## Stop
Loud talking during projects
* AP: (Matt) people should talk outside during project time

Invigilator to take SCG seriously
* AP: (Ryan)


## GO
Get projects ready for code review at 10am
* (Matt) This needs to happen

* AP: (Shireen) ready or not post the URL

Mentors will not answer questions after class. They have working hours 10-6.

* AP: (Shireen)
* (Matt) When in the classroom outside of office hours it is not always clear
* (Noor) It can be good getting the help

Mentors give feedback for each student

* (Noor) . This would be in addition to the walks as they are more pastoral.
* (Ghassan) Just ask for feedback
* (Haydn) It can be difficult for the mentors to keep in mind the state of the students. The onus should be on the students to keep it in your minds on things you should be working on. We could implement agile methodologies of talking about things we should improve on.
* (Shireen) It should be about the students helping themselves
* (Matt) Maybe we could get some feedback about tardiness to class
* AP: At the beginning of the week we all stand up and say how the last week went and how the future week went.

Add more time for the presentations

* (Suha)  We cannot discuss work during presentations.
* (Ryan) Last week we said that presentations were long on purpose to discuss. This week it is the opposite. If we have 15 mins, we don't need to mumble and fill the whole time. Saving the time would leave space for discussion
* (Yuseff) I value the bits where you can explain the tough parts of the code, more than the more generic project information stuff.
* (Shireen) In the real world, if it takes more than 15 minutes you don't know your application
* (Hayden) London and Gaza have 4 teams in the same time. The presentations aren't ready enough. You should be doing them the night before to be ready.
* AP: (Ryan) no need to rumble on about a project when it isn't anything new
* (Ryan) Suggests the first team going over everything. The 2nd only the bits that are different/interesting
* AP: (Ryan) The teams should be told the order in which they are presenting

Raising hands for questions

# Workshops

Super Test +-++

Error Handling +++++

* (Ben) I didn't know the point in error handling until the end of the week. Maybe we should be shown earlier

Node Shell +++

* (Matt) Best workshop we have done so far, a lot of on-the-job-learning

Research ++++

* (Matt) Where possible the Nazareth team should do three groups rather than four. The Tape formatter one could have been dropped in this case

Build request modules ++-

* (Ben) It needed some prompts along the way. It wouldn't take anything away from the workshop to do so.
* (Matt) It was difficult to follow

Intro to linters +++

* (Denis) It was short but sweet

Projects +-+
* (Denis) Quite similar to the last two weeks. We didn't do a huge amount different from the last times.
* (Ben) This may be on purpose to give everyone a chance to work on the same project
* (Ghassan) It helps you get used to using node
